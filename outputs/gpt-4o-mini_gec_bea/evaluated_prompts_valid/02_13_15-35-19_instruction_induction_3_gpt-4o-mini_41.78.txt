It's difficult to answer the question "What are you going to do in the future?" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds.
When I was younger, I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher, a saleswoman, and even a butcher. I don't know why.
I would like to study psychology because one day I would like to open my own psychology office and help people.
It's difficult because I'll have to study hard and a lot, but I think that if you like a subject, you'll find it easier to study.
Maybe I'll change my mind; maybe not.
I think that public transport will always be important in the future.
The rich will buy cars, but the poor always need to use buses or taxis.
I consider it more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in your own car than when traveling by other means.
Also, you'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something to become friends and exchange phone numbers.
In my experience, when I didn't have a car, I used to take the bus to school and back home.
In my opinion, the car isn't necessary when you have crashed in the street; at that moment, you realize the importance of public transport.
In India, we have various types of public transport, such as cycles, bikes, cars, trains, and flights.
Corrected sentence: Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place, the mode of transport is chosen accordingly.
But generally speaking, traveling by car is much more fun compared to other modes of transport.
This reminds me of a trip that I recently took to Agra.
It takes around 6 hours by national highway to go from Delhi to Agra.
We have stopped at hotels to have food, and just in case any of us feels hungry, we purchased some snacks right before the trip.
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want when we travel by car (which is impossible when traveling by train or by flight).
In addition to that, we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up feeling refreshed.
Due to the aforementioned reasons, I am going to conclude that traveling by car is much more convenient.

Dear Jo,
Corrected sentence: How are you? I'm writing to inform you that I have some advice on traveling and working in my country.
On the one hand, in my country there are a lot of places to travel.
Corrected sentence: For example, Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, and Valencia.
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit; for example, in Madrid, you can visit "Puerta del Sol" and "Las Cibeles.
The original sentence "I visit Madrid twice a year." is already grammatically correct. Therefore, no corrections are needed. Corrected sentence: I visit Madrid twice a year.
All summer, I visit Sevilla because I love this city, and I suggest that you visit Sevilla.
On the other hand, in my country there are few jobs because the economy is very bad.
Corrected sentence: But, if you want, I can look for a job for you.
My best friend is looking for someone responsible for looking after her sister.
Her sister is 6 years old, and you should look after her every weekend.
You will be interested in this job?
Thank you for your e-mail; it was wonderful to hear from you.

Today, public transport still plays an important role in the transport system, and it will continue to do so in the future.
Corrected sentence: Because public transport is a cost-effective and better resource for allocation in a mass transport system.
Corrected sentence: Also, people need not suffer high operating costs from running their own cars.
Corrected sentence: But it can use a cheaper way to get to their destination, especially since it is far away from home.
For example, I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane for traveling to another country.
Instead, it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane.
In my opinion, I think that public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people who don't have enough money to pay for a car, even if it is used. Therefore, public transport will continue to have a future, but people are going to use cars more than buses or the underground.
If we think about it, the car is better because we don't need to wait for it as we do when waiting for the bus or underground; however, on the other hand, a car costs more money than public transport.
By car, we can just stay with ourselves, which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we don't need to be around people that are unknown. However, if we choose public transport, we can meet friends or family, so both modes of transportation are good, and cars don't necessarily have to end up with public transport.
If I had to choose between both modes of transportation, I think I would probably choose a car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus.
In my community, we are very interested in the environment and ecological issues.
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden, with worms that eat and degrade all the organic waste from the school.
In some strategic points of the building, we have special trash cans to separate the garbage into organic waste, paper and cardboard, cans, and pet bottles. They also hold talks and presentations about environmental issues such as global warming and pollution.
The manager of this project is Miss June Sid, our science teacher.
All these initiatives have made us a recognized ecological community over the years.
Corrected sentence: Good morning everyone, today I want to share about my favorite sport.
My favorite sport is football. Why do I choose it? Well, football is an international sport, and people around the world love it so much! Examples include the Barclays Premier League, La Liga, the FIFA World Cup, and so on.
I believe that's all that will delight us.
By the way, my favorite football team is Manchester United; they are brilliant, they have amazing football players, and they are awesome.
