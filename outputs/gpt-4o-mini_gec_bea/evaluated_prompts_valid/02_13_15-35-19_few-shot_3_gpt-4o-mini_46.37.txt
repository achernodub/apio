It's difficult to answer the question "What are you going to do in the future?" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds.
When I was younger, I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher, a saleswoman, and even a butcher. I don't know why.
I would like to study psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people.
It's difficult because I'll have to study hard and a lot, but I think that if you like a subject, you'll study it more easily.
Maybe I'll change my mind; maybe not.
I think that public transport will always be important in the future.
The rich people will buy a car, but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi.
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in your own car than when traveling by public transport.
Also, you'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something to be friends and exchange your telephone number.
In my experience, when I didn't have a car, I used to use the bus to go to school and then return to my house.
In my opinion, the car isn't necessary when you have crashed in the street; in that moment, you realize the importance of public transport.
In India, we have various types of public transport, such as cycles, bikes, cars, trains, and flights.
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place, the mode of transport is chosen accordingly.
But generally speaking, travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport.
This reminds me of a trip that I recently took to Agra.
It takes around 6 hours by national highway to go from Delhi to Agra.
We have stopped at hotels for food, and just in case any of us feels hungry, we purchased some snacks just before the trip.
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want when we travel by car (which is impossible when traveling by train and flight).
In addition to that, we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up refreshed.
Due to the above-mentioned reasons, I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient.
My name is Sarah.
I am 17 years old.
I am looking forward to joining you in this year's summer camps.
I love children, and I enjoy looking after them. Also, I organized many sports activities before in my school.
In addition to that, I enjoy cooking.
My family thinks that my cook is amazing.
I hope that you give me the chance to join you.
Thanks
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends.
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere. When I travel to the beach, I like to play with my sister in the sand, and after that, we go to the sea.
It is very funny.
When I was young, I liked to play with the ball in the playground, and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a net for volleyball.
Dear Jo,
How are you? I'm writing to inform you that I have some advice on travelling and working in my country.
On the one hand, in my country there are a lot of places to travel.
For example, Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia.
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit; for example, in Madrid, you can visit "Puerta del Sol" and "Las Cibeles.
I visit Madrid twice a year.
All summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city, and I suggest that you visit Sevilla.
On the other hand, in my country there are few jobs because the economy is very bad.
But, if you want, I will look for a job from you.
My best friend is looking for people responsible for looking after her sister.
Her sister is 6 years old, and you should look after her every weekend.
You will be interested in this job?
Thank you for your e-mail; it was wonderful to hear from you.
I'm looking forward to seeing you.
Take care, Laura.
Today public transport still plays an important role in the transport system, and it will continue to do so in the future.
Because public transport is a cost-effective and better resource allocation in the mass transport system.
Also, people need not suffer high operating costs running their own car.
But it can use a cheaper way to get to their destination, especially if it is far away from home.
For example, I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane traveling to another country.
Instead, it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane.
In my opinion, I think that public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people who don't have enough money to pay for a car, even if it is used. Therefore, public transport will continue to have a future, but people are going to use cars more than buses or the underground.
If we think about it, the car is better because we don't need to wait for them as we do when waiting for the bus or underground; however, in another way, a car costs more money than public transport.
By car, we can just stay with ourselves, which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we don't need to be around people that are unknown. However, if we choose public transport, we can meet friends or family, so both modes of transportation are good, and cars don't necessarily need to end up with public transport.
If I had to choose between both modes of transportation, I think I would probably choose a car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus.
In my community, we are very interested in the environment and ecological issues.
We have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden, with worms that eat and degrade all the organic waste from the school.
In some strategic points of the building, we have special trash cans to separate the garbage into organic waste, paper and cardboard, cans, and pet bottles. They also held talks and presentations about environmental issues like global warming and pollution, etc.
The manager of all this project is Miss June Sid, our science teacher.
All these initiatives have made us all over the years a recognized ecological community.
Good morning everyone, today I want to share about my favorite sport.
My favorite sport is football. Why do I choose it? Well, football is an international sport; people around the world love it so much! Examples include the Barclays Premier League, La Liga, the FIFA World Cup, and so on.
I believe that's all that will delight us.
By the way, my favorite football team is Manchester United; they are brilliant, have amazing football players, and are awesome.
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream that was to be a superhero!
After many years, he still dreams of becoming a superhero.
He entered the university of medicine because he thinks that this profession is more similar to being a superhero.
Pass some years at the university, and he met a girl named Kate, and he fell in love with her, and she fell in love with him.
Kate was cursing the University of Fashion.
Then the two started to date.
Michael and Kate were so happy until one day when Michael said he dreamed of being a superhero. Kate became so nervous, saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid's dream, and that Michael was only dreaming, but that would never happen and that superheroes don't exist.
When she said that, Michael started to cry and get mad, saying that she was lying and didn't have a heart.
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment.
In the following day, she said sorry and they were happy again.
But when they get to the home of Michael, they fight again, and Michael gets a knife and kills her.
He cried with a lot of blood around.
Michael, get away from there.
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.
Public transportation is an important invention in human history; it brings a number of benefits to our lives.
For instance, we take the subway in order to avoid stuck in traffic.
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than taking public transportation; however, it would cause more damage to our lives and harm our environment.
Therefore, we need to think more about our future, our offspring.
Giving them a safe, clean, and comfortable place to live.
If there is no public transportation, traffic jams will be more serious than before.
In my country, Taipei, we always get stuck in traffic for about one hour in the morning.
I cannot imagine how long it will take me to get to school if there is no bus or MRT.
Car is convenient for humans, but it also brings harm to them.
For example, carbon dioxide, which is created by cars.
It causes global warming, which threatens our environment and harms our daily life.
We can see that there have been many serious and frequent weather disasters in recent decades, such as typhoons, hurricanes, wildfires, and mudslides.
What other precautions are usually taken?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film is shipped.
If the film doesn't arrive on time, it will be problematic.
Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process is started right away.
The pleasure of traveling.
People go; people come.
Every day, lots of people are traveling abroad, but what's the best way to do international travel?
The most important option for travel is, by far, the plane.
