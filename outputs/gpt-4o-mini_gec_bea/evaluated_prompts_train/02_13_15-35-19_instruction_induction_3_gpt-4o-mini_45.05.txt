The Computing Technology has advanced significantly in recent years, making old computers almost useless and increasing the difference between old and new computers with every new discovery.
As we can notice, old and new computers are vastly different; starting with the size, old computers were much bigger than new ones.
Old computers used to occupy an entire room; now, they are only the size of a box, or even the size of a book.
You can have a portable computer now and take it with you to every place you visit.
Old computers only allowed you to perform math tasks or play simple games with two colors (green and black), but now you can do whatever you want, such as creating or playing video games, writing or reading a book, connecting to the internet, watching or making videos, inventing new things to improve computing technology, and not just in two colors, but in thousands of them.
One of the greatest achievements of new computing is the internet, where you can connect to other computers, download files, and more via an Ethernet cable or a wireless connection (Wi-Fi).
Corrected sentence: Get wrecked, mate.
I went to the abandoned house and started to think of the best way to make his life miserable. I spent the next two weeks looking for ideas to make him suffer.
As I didn't find anything, I went to the place where he lived and started looking for information about his life. I found people he cared about, and as I continued to go to his house, I noticed he always went to the same place. So, I decided to follow him to the house, and I found out he was dating a girl who might be his girlfriend. Finally, I got an idea: I would drive him crazy just as he did with me. That way, she would think he had problems on his mind and left him. However, I thought about it again and realized that if I did that, she would try to help him, and they would become more united. So, I decided to drive them both crazy, almost to the brink of madness, just as he did with me!
Corrected sentence: But wait a minute, am I really so angry as to make this?
Corrected sentence: Yes!
I screamed; my anger had dominated my mind. I no longer had control over my actions, and I was afraid of what I had become and what I could do. I could not control myself, and the only thing I could think of was him suffering a slow death and the satisfaction I would feel when I finally had my revengeâ€”the best revenge.
But I was so mad at him and so anxious to make his life impossible, and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and bigger. I had made a decision: I was going to do it. If he dedicated four years of his life torturing me and not wanting me to be happy, I would take the time necessary for him to have a miserable life, and I won't stop until I have accomplished my goal.
I'm not in agreement with this idea completely.

Public transportation has been used more by people, and over the years, it has become cheaper and safer. However, some people prefer cars to such an extent that we must consider whether we agree with this preference and what our reasons for it are. This is what we will demonstrate in this essay.
About 40 years ago, there was nothing called public transportation, and people rarely owned cars. During that time, there were not even good facilities to move from one place to another, primarily because there were no companies to build cars. However, within about 10 years, car trading became viable and gained strong support from its own fans. In the beginning, they faced a lot of problems, but they were able to solve them by the end.
Nowadays, all modes of travel, from cars to buses, even trains and planes, are more convenient. Some people prefer cars because they do not like crowded places or because they find it sometimes cheaper. However, from another point of view, public transportation is very affordable and even faster. When it comes to traveling, many people prefer riding in their own cars to feel the real experience and enjoy more by escaping crowded places.
To summarize, it is different from one person's opinion to another. I predict that public transportation will improve and that people will use it more and more, so by the end, cars will disappear and will no longer be used.
The topic itself explains the uncertainty of public transport in our country.
This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and the exponential growth in their sales figures. With low-budget private cars in the picture, the scenario has drastically changed in the past 10 years.

The government should take immense action to stop it or at least slow it down.
However, we the people have a really important part in making it worse.
Active and good governments understand the value of taking care of trees, water, air, and much more to provide a fresh, clean, and safe environment for their people.
Recycling items can be a good step to start with a clean and safe environment, which is being taken care of perfectly and promptly by my city.
Everyone has to plant a tree in front of their home according to the rules of the provincial government.
People do not realize that cutting down trees can reduce the production of oxygen in the atmosphere.
Eventually, humans will have no more fresh air to breathe.
Additionally, our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas and for those under 18 years old, and it provides a free session of talks or presentations to increase awareness of a clean, safe, and fresh environment in the city.
In conclusion, I would suggest to our neighboring cities to take part in cleaning the environment so that one day it can be seen throughout the whole country.
