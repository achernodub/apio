Dear Sir ,
I have seen your advertisement for a job on the internet , and I am writing to apply for a summer position as an instructor and caregiver for children at your camp .
I am working as a teacher in a Spanish school with children aged between 8 and 14 .
I am an easygoing person with a lot of empathy for children .
On the other hand , in my leisure time , I usually do sports like jogging or swimming , adventure activities like trekking , climbing , or spelunking , and I have been doing these for 20 years .
I have traveled to most of the European countries , and I am able to understand , speak , and write three languages fluently : Spanish , English , and French .
It is the reason why I believe that I could be a suitable candidate for the job .
I would like to inform you that I will be able to work in the months of July and August .
I hope it has not been an inconvenience to you .
To that end , could you please tell me what salary you are offering for this job ?
The original sentence `` I look forward to hearing from you . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I look forward to hearing from you .
Corrected sentence : Best regards ,
It seems that `` Mirta Rojo '' is a name and does not contain any grammatical errors . If you intended to provide a longer sentence for correction , please share it , and I would be happy to help !
Hi . I am so happy to write here . My favorite sport is riding a bike ( bicycle ) .
It is nice and a good sport , especially when we try in the morning . It gives the body energy as well as regularizes the work of the heart .
Corrected sentence : For me , I have been doing this kind of sport for ten minutes daily . I do this sport because I have liked it since my childhood .
My advice to anyone starting to learn this sport is to be careful to avoid accidents because it requires more concentration from the person riding . That is all .
The original sentence `` Thank you '' is already grammatically correct . There are no errors to correct . Corrected sentence : Thank you .
I 've been studying English for several years , but I 'm not really sure what exactly my current goal is .
I 've been changing places , and I do n't know which one is best for me .
What I 'm sure about is the fact that I 'm going to need an official certificate in order to prove that I 've studied the language .
I study English because I love it , and I 'd like to speak very fluently and watch a movie without subtitles .
I understand perfectly when a native speaker is talking , but when I have to speak in English , it 's not so easy .
I 'm very motivated and I 'm going to continue with my studies , but I need to have clarity about where I 'm going .
I 'd like to teach the language to young children .
Next year , I 'm going to focus on speaking and perhaps I will do a formal test .
Otherwise , I would like to improve my grammar and writing , so I will keep trying hard .
Corrected sentence : Thank you for helping me . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
The British parliamentary electoral system is unfair and undemocratic . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No corrections are needed . )
It is , however , in my opinion , the best basis for government .
Consider a general election in which three parties , X , Y , and Z , stand in a country with 5,000 voters .
Corrected sentence : Supposing 2,000 people vote for Party X and 1,500 vote for Parties Y and Z , Party X would come into power because it has the most votes .
However , there were 3,000 people who did not want them to be in power , which is not the majority of the country .
Corrected sentence : Additionally , the idea is that each constituency has an MP who fights for that constituency 's beliefs in Parliament .
This sentence is already grammatically correct . However , if you would like a more detailed version , you could say : '' This statement has major flaws .
Corrected sentence : Consider , for example , the MP who recently decided that she wanted to change parties .
Yes , I know it is the MP 's belief that the constituents are meant to vote on the ideas of that MP , but this simply is n't the case in many circumstances ; the voter votes on how the party that the MP represents is doing at the moment .
Once a party is in government , it is free to do as it likes , changing its policies until the next general election , at which point it will make hollow promises about what it will do when it next gets into power , just to gain votes .
Corrected sentence : It is , as I said before , the best system . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
Corrected sentence : Consider dictatorships ; this falls at the first hurdle .
With this system , any madman can control a country , causing economic disasters not only for that country but also for other related countries .
There is no fair and perfect way to run a country . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
Corrected sentence : One can please some people some of the time , but not all people all of the time .
The only way a fair system of government can come about is with a group of no more than ten people , and even then , people are discontent .
Corrected sentence : Hi Karina ,
Corrected sentence : Thank you for your letter .
Corrected sentence : Of course , I can tell you about Dulan .
He 's 23 , studying electronic engineering at Kelaniya University , and he is a second-year student .
He has an elder sister who has just finished her IT degree , and now she is looking for a job .
His mother teaches biology to advanced level students at Ananda College in Colombo 10 , and his father works as an assistant manager at Peoples ' Bank .
He 's a cool , charming , and very sociable person .
Corrected sentence : He is also sensitive .
When someone faces trouble , he does n't look at others ; instead , he goes forward to help them as much as he can .
Not only is he a responsible and reliable guy .
Sometimes he borrows my personal things ( laptop , pen drives ) and gives them back to me on time as they are .
He 's incredibly hardworking . That 's the secret behind his exam results .
He likes going out with friends , watching movies , and listening to music using his hi-fi headset , so do n't worry about the noise ! He 's a good rugby player and plays for his university team . He 's crazy about computer games .
He had already finished many famous computer games when we left school , but he knows his limits and how to manage his studies without any disturbance .
The original sentence `` He 's keen on sports cars . '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : He 's keen on sports cars .
He has a large collection of pictures and videos of sports cars .
Also , he has quite a good knowledge of automobiles .
I know that most of the time he does some repairs by himself .
Corrected sentence : So it may be helpful for you during your holiday .
The only negative things I can think of are that he 's a bit untidy and not well organized .
His room is usually a mess , and sometimes he looks for his belongings for hours .
His English writing is very good , but he is n't a fluent speaker . I 'm sure he 'll learn it quickly .
Finally , I think he 's really nice and that you and your family will get along well with him .
I hope the above information is useful .
Let me know if you need more information about him . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no corrections are needed . )
Corrected sentence : Love ,
It seems that `` Lioyni '' is not a complete sentence and may not contain grammatical errors in the traditional sense . If you meant to provide a different sentence for correction , please share it , and I would be happy to help !
A very important characteristic of the UK constitution , and one that is central to the question of sovereignty , is that the Westminster Parliament is the supreme legal authority in the UK .
According to the orthodox school that subscribes to the views of Albert Venn Dicey , the Westminster Parliament is omnicompetent and can pass laws on any subject to regulate the activities of any person , anywhere , even those of aliens outside British territory .
In theory , then , the Westminster Parliament could pass a law banning smoking on the streets of London .
If our Parliament did so , British courts would be obliged to accept Parliament 's decision and pass judgment accordingly .
Of course , in practice , as the Radical school ( which believes that the Westminster Parliament is not legislatively supreme ) points out , in this hypothetical situation , the Parisians would take no notice whatsoever of the UK Parliament 's legislation ; and Parliament would , in effect , be fettered .
Dicey said that since each Parliament is omnipotent and therefore has the power to make or unmake any law , no Parliament can bind its successors regarding the content , manner , or form of subsequent legislation .
The radicals like to point out that since the passing of the European Communities Act in 1972 , the Westminster Parliament has ceded its sovereignty and supremacy to Europe .
The orthodox school retaliates by pointing out that since a Westminster Parliament passed the 1972 Act , thereby putting the UK into the European Communities , a future Parliament could just as easily repeal this Act and take us out of Europe again .
In this case , Britain would have retained its sovereignty and parliamentary supremacy .
Corrected sentence : Of course , this whole question is still a subject of fierce debate . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
British courts have avoided a head-on clash by finding ambiguity in a domestic statute and resolving that ambiguity to give effect to our Community obligations , or by finding that a statute passed prior to the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed by implication by that Act and does not represent the latest intention of the Westminster Parliament , or by arguing that subsequent legislation was inadvertent and that the Westminster Parliament could not have intended to come into conflict with community law .
In a recent development , the European Court of Justice ruled in the case of R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame and others ( 1990 ) that courts in Britain must suspend an Act of the Westminster Parliament where the rights of citizens guaranteed by European Community law may be at risk .
This case stated for the first time that it is a principle of UK law , as influenced by the European Court , that our Parliament is not supreme in every circumstance .
It would seem , therefore , that the advent of a single Europe is indeed meaning a loss of sovereignty for Britain , whatever the orthodox school may think to the contrary.Corrected sentence : It would seem , therefore , that the advent of a single Europe is indeed meaning a loss of sovereignty for Britain , regardless of what the orthodox school may think to the contrary .
Young people are interested in many things , such as games , music , television programs , and the clothes they wear .
Corrected sentence : Young people , like children , enjoy playing games , listening to music , watching TV , and wearing special clothes .
Corrected sentence : Now , in 2015 , the game that young people are interested in is speed stacking .
In music , they are interested in Taylor Swift 's songs because they are so wonderful ; I hear them every day .
Television programmes that young people do n't like are actually those that have horror films , romantic films , and films with happy endings , but they prefer channels that feature these genres .
This year , there are fantastic clothes everywhere , especially in the UAE .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in connection with your job advertisement for the summer camps in the USA .
I am a twenty-year-old student from Poland , and I am looking for an interesting job for the summer holidays .
I would like to apply for the job you are offering , and I intend to prove that I am an appropriate candidate .
In Poland , I have been a Scout for ten years .
There I had various tasks ; one of them was looking after younger children .
I helped organize Scout camps all over my country .
We organized many sports and cultural activities .
Apart from being a Scout , I have also been a lifeguard at kitesurfing camps in Poland .
I am not afraid of working in the kitchen .
I am also able to perform the harder tasks , such as washing the dishes and tidying up .
I believe you will consider my application .
Corrected sentence : Yours faithfully ,
Please provide the sentence you would like me to correct .
I beg to differ : crime does pay .
Many criminals live far better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
Being a criminal has its advantages ; you do n't have to worry about being fired , you can make more money in less time , you set your own hours because you 're your own boss , and you can retire well before the age of 65 .
Let 's take the time to compare the criminal life to that of a hardworking person .
In our changing economy , any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with whether or not he or she will continue to have that job .
Many people are being laid off or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay their employees .
A criminal will always be employed . Corrected sentence : A criminal will always find employment .
Corrected sentence : There is never a lack of work as a means for continuing employment .
Corrected sentence : Then , if we think about the workday of most working people .
The average worker works eight hours per day .
They make about $ 7.50 per hour for their work .
This is $ 300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
Tax deductions will run about $ 69.00 per week , and deductions for medical/dental insurance will cost them another $ 5.00 per week , bringing their actual take-home pay to $ 266.00 per week .
The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $ 300.00 without having to be concerned about deductions for medical insurance and taxes .
Further , the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific number of hours each day .
The criminal is his or her own boss .
Corrected sentence : And finally , the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker is retirement .
However , the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if he or she has managed to save portions of the dollars stolen over the years .
If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 , he or she could be set for life .
At $ 300.00 per hour for 15 years , the criminal earns $ 1,170,000.00 .
If he or she invests half of this money and earns interest , they could potentially live on the interest income alone .
Corrected sentence : Comparing both options , I would definitely say that crime pays .
I was born in Thailand and have been living in Samut Prakan , which is a small city near Bangkok .
There are many types of transportation in Thailand . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
I often take a motorcycle , a minibus , and finally the BTS .
The corrected sentence is : `` The bus is a mode of transportation that I rarely take .
Corrected sentence : Based on my experience .
Motorcycles are very convenient transportation .
It is the fastest mode of transportation when you are in a rush .
Corrected sentence : Even though it is needed urgently .
On the other hand , it is not very good for safety .
Motorcycles are the most dangerous form of transport in Thailand compared to others .
Even if we have traffic rules , some riders still keep breaking them .
Continue with the minibus ; there are some rules for this type of transportation .
The drivers have to follow the traffic rules . ( Corrected sentence : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
I found that it is good transportation , which costs low prices and travels a long distance .
Therefore , people in the low to medium class prefer to use this mode of transport .
People who live around the city usually make an appointment in downtown .
Corrected sentence : Because of a heavy traffic jam in Bangkok , they tried to avoid other routes .
Corrected sentence : Then , BTS is the best option .
Corrected sentence : It is very satisfying in terms of time and convenience .
People can manage their time more easily because BTS is fixed in time .
Therefore , this transport is the most predictable .
Thailand is a country that is not strict about the rules .
Corrected sentence : Therefore , news about accidents in the country can be heard .
Corrected sentence : Customers and drivers are not disciplined .
My suggestion for the problems mentioned above is to start showing people how much priority regulations have .
Corrected sentence : Drivers , customers , or even police officers should cooperate .
Corrected sentence : Dear Mrs. Kate Ashby ,
I am studying English , and I can speak it very well . Esosel is in the third year of college .
I would like to deal with people , and I can speak many languages , so I can communicate well with them .
I would like to work long hours on weekends because during the weekdays I go to college , and I am happy to work long hours on weekends .
It seems that the sentence you provided is missing . Please provide the sentence you would like me to correct , and I 'll be happy to help !
Humanity witnessed one of history 's most incredible minds at work when Albert Einstein came onto the scene .
Although his theory , which includes both his and his wife 's contributions , was basically scientific in nature , it can and has been applied to all areas of human existence .
The theory I am speaking of is relativity .
With this theory also came the field of quantum mechanics .
It is difficult to condense this topic , which has volumes of literature .
Personally , I find that relativity has not yet had its full impact .
This is probably for several reasons : First , the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are in reference to that point of departure is quite abstract .
It seems impossible , and it leaves humans grasping for closure .
What Einstein did to humanity 's philosophy was change the notion that closure could be achieved .
The Socratic idea that all is known .
Corrected sentence : And it was only a matter of time before a `` moment '' would reveal that the knowledge from `` within '' was , in effect , shattered .
The philosopher 's stone was pulverized into utopian and nostalgic dust .
Since it is my socialization that leads me to have a notion of earth time ( 24 hours = day ) , I think Einstein reconstructed part of it .
Although I do n't claim to understand relativity , I 've attempted to delve into the topic [ like Siddhartha and his rock ] .
The point is that my notion of time has changed , and I think that once humanity realizes that time notions are human constructions and are subject to change , the impact of Einstein 's idea will then be felt .
For now , we are left with a world that has used Einstein 's `` invention '' for intentions not worthy of the genius , namely atomic bombs .
The significance of atomic bombs can not be overestimated when speaking about humanity in the 20th century .
It set up a whole network of global systems .
Corrected sentence : The USA and the USSR , along with Japan and Germany , were considered the `` winners .
Corrected sentence : Cold wars : North-South relations .
Many things have been generated , namely fear !
Relatively speaking , fear has been the main point of departure for the construction of the global community .
This is a point that I think needs to be changed from fear to peace .
A shift in focus , if you will .
Some would say this is too utopian ;
But if humanity sought to understand relativity ( as Stephen Hawking does ) , our notions would be radically changed .
For now , we must deal with the shortcomings of humanity 's use of Einstein 's ideas : atomic weapons .
Corrected sentence : Yesterday , I went to a basketball club . In my first training session , I scored 4 baskets .
Corrected sentence : It was the first time for me to play basketball .
I think I am very good .
My dream is to be a basketball player . Playing basketball is really fun and enjoyable .
Corrected sentence : I loved playing it . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
Corrected sentence : I want to play it again . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
It is undeniable that animals are vital to medical research for their beneficial merits .
Researchers can use animals ( such as mice and monkeys ) to examine the new drugs .
Furthermore , animals were probably used to determine the amount of dosage .
These usages certainly identify whether the vaccine is functional .
In addition , it defines the maximum dosage beyond which the drug becomes lethal .
Also , one of the main purposes of using an animal in the lab is that the antidote for its bite , such as that of snakes , has to be extracted from their body .
Even a bite could kill a person if a suitable antidote is not available .
Writing about my favorite sport is discussing one of the best things in my life , since I 'm a sports fan and have been so all my life .
While I was in high school , I still recall dreading the moment I had to go to gym class , but somehow later in life , I discovered that sports would not just save my life .
Corrected sentence : Furthermore , it became one of my favorite pastimes .
No matter what my mood was , putting on my trainers and finding a new place to discover made the possibilities endless : parks , the beach , and running tracks .
Corrected sentence : Getting lost in the middle of the woods ... anytime , anywhere .
Corrected sentence : Then , one thing led to another , and starting rollerblading , cycling , skiing , or just going to the gym on rainy days totally changed my mood .
Little did I know at that time that I would meet the love of my life thanks to sports .
To conclude , I would like to leave a message to all those young people out there who do n't seem to fit anywhere .
Taking part in any free-time activity would help you become a better person .
You will learn to share , to compete , and to lead a healthier life .
Believe that the potential lies deep within you and that the sky is the limit . Corrected sentence : Believe that your potential lies deep within you and that the sky is the limit .
Corrected sentence : As it is said in the book `` Say It Again , See It Again , '' artistic research is quite complicated and a topic that is discussed a lot .
In academic fields , there is some question of how artistic research relates to research within the academic framework .
Corrected sentence : When we look it up in the dictionaries to find the definition of research in academic study , we read this definition :
The systematic investigation and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions .
According to the UNESCO definition , research is `` any creative , systematic activity undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge , including knowledge of man , culture , and society , and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications .
Another source said that research involves searching for and gathering information , usually to answer a particular question or problem .
When we look for artistic research .
It is said that artistic research is a process of making artwork .
Those two terms , academic research and artistic research , mainly differ in the results of the research .
In the academic field , after conducting research , we gain some knowledge that can be generalized .
A conclusion of the academic research becomes the law that remains over time .
While engaging in artistic research , we work with singular knowledge that is unique .
Corrected sentence : `` It can not really be established as a law or a long-term statement . Due to the experimental nature of the research , the unpredictable , multidisciplinary , and creative character of artistic research makes it difficult to define what artistic research truly is .
Corrected sentence : Artistic research does not only produce knowledge .
It changes people 's mindsets .
Artistic research is a form of research because artists seek knowledge in order to create artwork .
Corrected sentence : So in art , research exists in the artwork itself .
I have read in the book about artistic research that artists are doing their research without calling it research .
Corrected sentence : Mrs. Kate Ashby ,
I would like to apply for a weekend job at Green Pepper Cafe .
I am a twenty-one-year-old student .
Food is the most important part of my life ; it makes me happy .
I really like to cook different kinds of dishes from all over the world for my friends .
I am used to working long hours because last holiday I had a full-time job in a bar on the beach .
I am an open-minded and cheerful person who loves to meet new people and learn new things .
I think that I am a calm and friendly person ; for me , a satisfied client is a happy client .
I also know Spanish ; it could be helpful to talk with tourists from Spain .
I hope you would like to meet with me and get to know more about my experience working in bars and cafes .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Corrected sentence : With kind regards , Clarita .
Watching `` Cuéntame '' might not be the first film you think of when considering the last century in Spain , but in fact , it is a good example of our country 's history during that time .
Although it was shot last year by a young director , he has known how difficult life is , so it is more than likely that he studied in detail society , customs , clothes , and hair trends because elders say it is a true reflection of Spaniards ' lives .
Even more , pensioners said that the movie reminds them of their youth , so it is a realistic film .
On the other hand , it is more than likely that they could be a bit sad , homesick , and maybe they could lose a tear too .
The movie would reflect the life of an average family with a toddler , two teenage children , and a grandmother who is always wearing black clothes because she lost her husband in the Spanish Civil War .
As the parents are working , she used to do the housework and take care of her grandchildren .
On top of that , it is witnessing the beginning of the age of democracy and how hard the birth of some political parties was . Of course , it is also showing us how women are beginning to smoke , wear skinny trousers , and obtain a driver 's license .
It was a strange change in this country .
To sum up , I strongly recommend this movie not only for students and young people but also for middle-aged and older adults . In addition , it could be a great movie for foreigners , as it allows them to easily understand our history .
Dear Mrs. Ashby ,
I would like to work in the café on the weekend .
I have worked at a cafe many times before and enjoy meeting people . I have used Green Pepper Cafe many times and have drunk coffee there .
It was very good , and the people working there are happy .
I want to work at your place because I am interested in many types of food , and I really enjoy meeting people .
I also work long hours in a café , which I like .
Corrected sentence : Please tell me soon if I have an interview .
Corrected sentence : Schooling of the children
I think children must be educated at school , not at home .
Corrected sentence : Because at school they can interact with other people , learning from a young age how to handle different situations , thoughts , and cultures , and learn from those experiences .
Corrected sentence : Knowledge is not just what we learn while sitting in a chair , but also how to deal with society .
Corrected sentence : It does n't make any sense for a person to be very smart , intelligent , and knowledgeable about so many subjects if he ca n't express himself and his ideas .
If he can not act naturally when facing difficulties or stay calm while dealing with others ' thoughts , which are different from his ideas , he will not demonstrate how flexible he can be in difficult situations .
The knowledge is a combination of the intellectual and emotional parts of our brain .
It must be a balance between these two parts .
Corrected sentence : Teaching the child alone at home is not a good idea for his development .
The advantage of teaching the child at home is that you can see and follow exactly what he is learning , the time of study , and observe closely what the child is assimilating .
Corrected sentence : But , like I said before , it 's very important to help them deal with other people and situations since it 's essential to combine the rational and emotional parts of their brains .
It 's a hard decision for parents , especially for those who want to control all aspects of their children 's lives , but it 's necessary to understand how important a decision like that is for the future of those kids .
It 's more important to keep control of everything or to let the child learn from his experiences and develop other skills .
I really like football .
I do n't know why ; I just love that . My favorite club is Real Madrid , and my favorite football players are Kaka and CR7 .
I do n't care ; I 'll watch my favorite club match every time .
Corrected sentence : Through football , I can see him .
He 's my favorite player , more favorite than Kaka .
If I can watch his competition , I 'll watch it .
Corrected sentence : He 's also my spirit .
I have loved football since I was in 1st grade of junior high school . Usually , I watched football matches with my father .
Corrected sentence : At midnight , we were watching together .
My lovely team , the Country Garuda Team , you 're the best in the world .
My hope is that the national football team of Indonesia could become a big and the best team .
The original sentence `` This idea is completely erroneous . '' is already grammatically correct . There are no errors to correct . Corrected sentence : This idea is completely erroneous .
Corrected sentence : Money , perhaps , is a necessary evil in order to conduct the daily affairs of life .
Money , in some form or another , is required in order to carry out business trading , commerce , and the exchange of property .
Money enables a human being to store what they own , to pay their expenses , to share with others , or even to give to those in need .
Corrected sentence : However , it is true that the love of money is the root of all evil . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
This is a different concept altogether .
The desire for what we may not have can at times cause people to conduct themselves in a way that they might not otherwise conduct themselves .
Although there is a healthy desire to meet our needs , at times this desire can be pushed to an extreme .
How many times have we seen on the evening news a family being broken apart , a company going under , or even a nation crumbling simply because there was a desperate desire , on the part of one or many , for something that exceeds what is actually needed or required ?
Even individuals who are in constant search of what evades them can be destroyed .
They think that having the `` right '' car , living in the `` right '' neighborhood , or knowing the `` right '' people can bring them happiness and contentment .
This love of money urges them on , causes them to neglect their families , and at times leads them to commit crimes for which they are imprisoned .
Our society pays dearly , both financially and socially , for its love affair with money .
It is a cross-cultural thing .
We can be speaking of the American dollar , the Japanese yen , or the Spanish peseta .
The love of whatever represents the financial exchange between parties wreaks havoc on a nation , a family , and even an individual 's life .
Not the money itself , but rather the love of it , persuades men 's hearts , captivates their minds , and influences their priorities and behavior .
The hoarding of wealth for personal benefit or security , when pushed to an extreme , is the root of all evil .
It produces selfishness even in the smallest child .
It 's not long before a 4- to 5-year-old realizes the power that money brings .
He begins to hide it , save it , ask for it , and spend it .
A healthy thing can be turned into a tool for disaster . Is money the root of all evil ?
Corrected sentence : No .
Corrected sentence : It can be used for good .
It can bring relief to those in need and even extra joy into a life that already has its needs met .
However , the love of it , the overwhelming desire for it that causes people to overlook what is most important and at times even commit terrible acts toward each other , is truly the root of all evil .
Corrected sentence : History is the identity of people ; it can tell future generations about the past .
Corrected sentence : As all nations and peoples have their own histories , it is important to distinguish them by the marks they have left .
Corrected sentence : Historical places , as well as archives , are the most common things that show ancient life .
Corrected sentence : Every nation has its own identity .
In my country , there are a lot of historical places that refer to different civilizations .
But the place that attracts the most people is the capital ; we can call it the crossroads of civilization .
Different civilizations set up there , from Byzantine to French , passing through Ottoman and others .
Our attractive historical place in CASBAH .
CASBAH is a historical city and has an important story about its construction .
I believe I would be a good person for the summer camp staff .
Corrected sentence : Besides , I raised two children , and most children are very fond of me .
I always enjoy sports , especially basketball , tennis , and dancing .
Corrected sentence : I am also good at cooking and reading books .
I hope you will select me for the job .
Corrected sentence : Dear Isabel ,
My new town is wonderful .
The original sentence `` I really enjoy living here ! '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : I really enjoy living here !
My town is near a lake and is situated between two bigger towns .
The main attractions are a historic museum and a very large indoor bath .
My favorite place in town is a bank by the lake .
The original sentence `` I love to sit there and watch the sunrise . '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : I love to sit there and watch the sunrise .
Best wishes from my lovely new home !
I live in a tiny village named Fals , where there are n't many people ; there are only , more or less , one hundred people .
In my little village , most people are farmers , and they do n't use many cars or motorbikes ; they just use trucks and other vehicles .
So I think that in my village we take care of the environment because we do n't produce a lot of pollution . Therefore , I can say that I live in a healthy village in terms of pollution .
But in my country , we usually do n't take care of the environment because people in Spain do n't think of others ; they just think about themselves .
Although most of the Spanish people do n't think about the environment because they say it 's not the present ; it 's the future .
The childhood of today is really involved with technology .
Most of the fun for children comes from video games , television , computers , and tablets , which they use to play electronic games and watch movies or cartoons .
On this way , it is clear that television entertains and is a part of our lives , but it can also educate if it has appropriate subjects .
For example , some cartoons with their characters can teach children to count in other languages , solve math problems as simple additions , and , most importantly , help children learn how to deal with their parents and friends , as well as understand what is wrong or right . In other words , television can influence their behavior .
On the other hand , there are a lot of advertisements on television that can affect some choices and desires of children , such as certain toys , leading them to ask for these items simply because of the media .
Therefore , it is very important that parents have knowledge about what their children are watching and learning on TV .
Thus , television could be good for education , but the time in front of the screen has to be controlled ; after all , childhood is also constructed through playing in the open air !
It is apparently due to the huge improvement in the automobile industry , which has created a better transportation environment with dramatic advancements in transport .
You can easily travel from place A to place B by stepping into a private car , which will create an electronic delivery lane and compress the data of the car with the driver .
Drivers simply ignite the car engine , choose the destination with the accurate address , map the three dimensions of street view , and then drive .
In just five minutes , you arrive , literally .
With the new way of driving , people do not have to walk along a 500-meter road to public transportation , such as train stations or bus stations , while buying modern cars that provide a better transportation experience .

No doubt that all of us dream of living in a healthy environment , which requires a lot of effort from both the people and the government .
Corrected sentence : But in fact , this did not happen 100 % of the time , as most people are not committed to this ; most of them always put their rubbish in the streets instead of in the designated places .
In the village , the farmers always throw the tailings and the dead bodies of animals into the canals , which pollutes the water they use for watering the farmlands , leading to food pollution .
As a matter of fact , there is an enormous quantity of ways to transmit information , which has always been extremely important for people , especially nowadays .
We can receive information from old-fashioned or traditional sources , such as books , as well as from contemporary types of media , such as TVs and radio .
Due to the fact that all kinds of sources have advantages and disadvantages , some arguments will be considered to find the most effective one .
Actually , broadcasting activities are great opportunities to get the latest news about situations in the world or the latest knowledge in different fields of science , whereas books can present obsolete or inadequate information .
Indeed , scientists have proven that about half of the information in books becomes outdated in 5 to 10 years .
In contrast , we can find that some data from the television and the radio are deliberately distorted .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , there is an opinion that the media is the fourth estate and can influence our consciousness .
It is too hard to disagree with it when the information became a means of warfare rather than a method of enlightenment .
Then books come to the forefront as a means of understanding history : all human experience , which has accumulated over the entirety of human existence , is represented there .
In conclusion , I guess that we should not choose the only way of communicating information , as all types of media have pros and cons .
Choosing the appropriate option for receiving certain data is a skill we should learn .

Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to apply for the volunteer position you advertised in Summer Holidays Magazine for summer camps in the USA .
I am 23 years old , and I have just finished my studies in Teaching at the University of Seville .
After summer , I would like to work at a prestigious center in Birmingham , 'The Good Shepherd School , ' so learning from a summer camp in the United States of America would be a great opportunity for me .
As you can see from my attached Curriculum Vitae , I have been working as a nanny for two years , and I also have five little cousins whom I had to look after on many occasions .
In addition , I worked at summer camps last summer , where I was in charge of planning and leading games and craft activities .
Being a leader made me develop a strong sense of responsibility .
In addition , I am about to take the CAE ( Certificate in Advanced English ) in a few weeks .
I love learning English ; in fact , I have some English exchange partners whom I talk to twice a week .
I believe a good teacher is someone who can entertain children , play with them , and teach them how to improve their skills .
I think I have all these abilities , and I am perfectly capable of doing this job .
I look forward to hearing from you .

There are several reasons why people in the UK might stop eating beef .
For example , everyone may suddenly become vegetarian , or tastes may alter in such a way that nobody in the UK wants to eat beef .
However , these occurrences are , at best , unlikely .
The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease eating beef is the disease CJD .
This disease is the human equivalent of `` mad cow disease '' or BSE .
In recent years , there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE .
This seems to have been mainly caused by farming methods used 20 years ago .
In the 1960s and 1970s , cows were given feed that included sheep ( and their brains ) in its ingredients .
Many animals that ate this feed developed BSE , and even more passed it on to their young .
There is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous , as they believe that BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef .
There is currently no scientific evidence to suggest that this is the case .
However , cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media , and this has greatly influenced people .
Pictures on the television of cows with BSE that are unable to walk properly and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is .
If the media coverage of CJD and BSE continues in the same manner , it is not inconceivable that people in the UK might become so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely .
If people in the UK were to cease eating beef , the effect on the agricultural industry would be devastating .
Cow farmers would decrease in number by a significant amount .
This is because , with the beef market destroyed , the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market , which is not large enough to sustain many sellers .
The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products , and if this happened , cow farmers would cease to exist entirely .
However , when people cease to eat beef , what do they eat instead ?
The answer is pork , lamb , and other meats .
The increase in demand for the other meats would be approximately proportional to the fall in demand for beef .
This would mean that producers of other meats would benefit from people ceasing to eat beef .
Although cattle farmers could no longer remain in the beef market , they could switch from cattle farming to pig or sheep farming and stay in the agricultural industry .
The overall effect on the size of the agricultural industry would be virtually nonexistent .
This is because the decline in the size of the beef market would correspond with an increase in the size of the other agricultural product markets .
This would mean that the structure of the agricultural industry has altered greatly , with the proportion taken up by the meat market , other than beef , growing .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing with reference to your advertisement that I saw in the magazine two weeks ago .
I am very interested in this vacancy .

In order to ensure safety for them , my school sometimes asks me to attend first-aid courses , which give me the confidence to deal with emergency situations .
Corrected sentence : I am particularly free from June to September .

I 'm Paloma , your new pen pal ! I come from an island called Cozumel , and I like sports and hanging out with my friends .
Corrected sentence : What did you do on vacation ?
I went to Cancún , visited museums , and went to Xpu-Ha , a really beautiful beach where we stayed in an apartment nearby .
Corrected sentence : There , I saw a lot of tourists who were almost crying because they ate chili . I laughed a lot , and so did my friends . Do not underestimate the power of chili .
Do you have brothers or sisters ? I have two little ones , one who is 11 years old and the other who is 7 .
I have seven pets : 1 parrot , 2 dogs , 2 hamsters , and 2 turtles . I think it 's a little more than normal .
Corrected sentence : I am looking forward to receiving your letter !
Corrected sentence : A hug is comforting .
It seems that the sentence provided is incomplete , as it only contains the word `` Paloma . '' To assist you effectively , please provide a complete sentence that contains grammatical errors , and I will help identify and correct them .

I am 35 years old and from Spain , although I am studying literature in London .

I like reading books in other languages because I speak Spanish , English , and French fluently .
I have experience in this area because I worked in another bookshop with temporary jobs last summer .

The original sentence `` Thank you for considering my application . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : Thank you for considering my application .

Corrected sentence : Interestingly , this topic is very important to me .
I often dwell on the characteristics of mankind that lead us to continually invent new things . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
We seem to be somewhat obsessed with technology and using it to dominate nature as well as our fellow man .
Technology and inventions seem to stem from our natural fear of death and our human insecurities . Corrected sentence : Technology and inventions seem to stem from our natural fear of death and our insecurities as humans .
We attempt to dominate nature so that we may live without fearing death , and we attempt to dominate other people so that we may live free from our petty insecurities .
For these reasons , I would argue that the only inventions of the twentieth century that have significantly changed people 's lives for the better are those that have occurred in the medical field .
Although these inventions do stem from a fear of death , they do not attempt to dominate nature or other human beings as the majority of other inventions do .
The original sentence `` They save lives . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : They save lives .
By closely analyzing the nature of modern inventions , one notes a consistent trend that leads away from a lifestyle that is peacefully coexistent with nature .
We are , ourselves , a part of nature , yet we attempt to live outside it .
We continue to destroy the plants , animals , and the earth itself , and our new inventions help us do it in more efficient ways .
Therefore , inventions in the 20th century have had , for the most part , a negative effect on our lives because by destroying nature , we 're destroying ourselves .
In addition , our inventions are used to dominate each other .
We invent better weapons and more effective economic systems designed for killing and depriving others .
Medical inventions , on the other hand , are designed to help people of all colors and can not be used to dominate nature or other people .
They are one of the only truly `` kind '' expressions of mankind 's creativity .
In modern society , especially in developed countries , traffic and all the problems related to it affect the socioeconomic conditions of the entire population .
Many governments argue that these problems can be solved by increasing the cost of petrol .
To my mind , this should not be the right way to solve them ; rather , other measures need to be carried out .
In many overcrowded cities , such as New York and Tokyo , the primary cause of air pollution is the chaotic and uncontrolled flow of vehicles that use fossil fuels to operate .
This trend will certainly increase in the future due to the large number of people who are moving from the countryside to the city .
This phenomenon happens especially in developing countries , such as those in Africa .
However , an increase in fuel prices is not effective in reducing traffic flow .
Indeed , over the last fifty years , this price has shown a dramatic increase , but air pollution continues to rise .
It can be seen in some virtuous towns , such as Oslo in Norway , that encouraging people to use bicycles is an excellent way to reduce traffic and its consequences .
The said encouragement can be carried out by a decrease in taxes or other monetary benefits for those who ride their bikes instead of driving a car .
Another way to reduce traffic is the enhancement of the public transport system , which includes larger trains , more bus lines , and so on .
In fact , many people prefer to travel by car because trains are often overcrowded or because they have to wake up early in the morning to catch the bus .
In conclusion , although increasing petrol prices could be effective in the short term , this measure can not reduce the use of fossil fuels and , therefore , the problem related to traffic .
However , better solutions can be found by making people aware of the benefits of reduced car use .
Corrected sentence : Good morning ,
Last week , I traveled by air with your airline . The trip was good , but I lost my luggage .
Corrected sentence : It is big , fluorescent pink with blue lines .
I went to the staff to tell them about this situation , and they told me to send an email to the company .
Corrected sentence : So I 'm writing to receive my luggage .
I hope that you can find it because it contains things that are very important to me .
Corrected sentence : Write to me soon !
It seems that the sentence provided is incomplete , as it only contains the name `` Noemi . '' Please provide a complete sentence that contains grammatical errors , and I will be happy to help you identify and correct them .
I 'm very pleased that you took that into account .
I 'm an Italian girl , I 'm nineteen years old , and I live with my parents and my twin siblings in the south of Italy .
When I was a baby , I used to go to summer camps with my family ; I 'm growing up in a camp .
I think that I can be a suitable person for this job because I look after my brothers , who are five years old , and I love cooking and playing with them . I grew up in the south , and here in the summer , there are many summer camps where I usually work , so I have experience .
Hoping to have satisfied your requests , I 'm waiting for your answer .
The people living in my town are not very environmentally friendly .
They are not that way-minded .
Corrected sentence : For example , when it is time to take out the rubbish , the Town Hall sets a specific time for this task .
Instead , the citizens choose not to do it during this time , but at any other time they feel like .
I do n't think this is a very proper thing to do .
My teacher asked me what I do in my free time .
I always enjoy playing video games , and I usually do so at night .
I do it at night because I study in the afternoon ; I enjoy doing it .
I hang out regularly with my friends , and we enjoy ourselves a lot .
I think I am a privileged teenager . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
In the past , people used to use public transport , and now people also use public transport , but at a lower rate than in the past .
In my opinion , very few people will use it in the future , and maybe no one will .
To start with , all people will prefer using cars to using public transport .
This is because when people use public transport , it tires them from standing and waiting for a long time in a crowd .
Also , having their own car will help them easily go to any place they want without standing and waiting to find public transport to take them .
Furthermore , bikes and walking will replace public transportation .
This is because people are now taking care of themselves and their health .
Corrected sentence : So , they prefer using bikes to using cars or public transportation for their health and for saving the environment from pollution .
Moreover , in the future , public transportation may be banned to avoid the real harm caused by its toxic fumes .
Corrected sentence : Besides , it harms the environment , which can cause acid rain and global warming .
To conclude , public transport is not useful anymore .
I believe that they will end because of their harms , which are far greater than their benefits .
Drinking has been a custom in the U.S. for many decades . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
Corrected sentence : Ever since the Wild West , the Civil War , and the drafting of the Declaration of Independence .
People under the age of twenty-one are considered to be minors when it comes to drinking alcoholic beverages in the United States .
At eighteen , you are considered a man ; therefore , you should be able to decide your own fate and make your own decisions .
Eighteen should be the legal age for consuming alcohol in the United States .
You can be condemned to go to war in the United States at the age of eighteen , but you can not drink a beer like all the other adults over the age of twenty-one .
Kids are dying for our country in wars , but the government still will not allow them to drink .
How can you think you are a man and fight in combat when the government says that you are too young to do what all of the other adults do ?
I think if you can hold a gun and fight for your country , you should be able to feel the effects of drinking alcohol .
Kids are getting into too much trouble trying to hide their drinking from their parents .
Most kids aged eighteen to twenty are out of high school , and their parents do not care what they do .
A high school diploma should indicate that you are old enough to make mature decisions .
You can say that some kids who are eighteen and older do not have a diploma .
You can make a rule that if you do not have a diploma and you are under twenty-one , then you are not allowed to drink .
Maybe a higher percentage of teenagers will graduate , thinking that if they have a diploma , they will be able to do anything an adult can do .
There would be less crime in the United States among teenagers if eighteen-year-olds were allowed to drink .
Corrected sentence : Most crimes among teenagers involve drinking and driving .
They are left with the decision to drink and drive because they are trying to hide it from their parents .
They can not drink in their own household , so they have to do it somewhere their parents would not find out . Corrected sentence : They can not drink in their own household , so they have to do it somewhere their parents will not find out .
Eighteen-year-olds would not be put in jail for possessing alcohol in the car either , which is another high-percentage crime among teenagers .
Drinking should be prohibited to kids under eighteen or older .
If the government passes a law allowing them to drink , it will just make the U.S. a better environment to live in .
If anything , the military should convince the government to pass a law allowing teenagers to drink .
If they pass that law , I will feel more like an adult and accept more responsibility because I am one .
The invention of the airplane , in my opinion , has drastically changed the lives of many people . Corrected sentence : The invention of the airplane , in my opinion , has drastically changed the lives of many individuals .
Air transportation allows people to travel from place to place more quickly and efficiently , and overseas travel has been drastically affected .
Without the airplane , my trip from the U.S. to Spain would have taken an extraordinary amount of time—maybe a week .
The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely vacation travel ; business , entertainment , and intercontinental relations have also felt the impact of the airplane .
As I 've already said , the area of travel has greatly improved due to the airplane .
Travel times have been significantly shortened ; for example , driving from Michigan to California takes about 30 to 35 hours , but flying the same distance takes about 3 hours .
This allows people a greater variety of places to travel , and they can spend their vacation time at their chosen destination , not trying to get there .
The business world has definitely flourished due to airplanes .
As a result of the greatly decreased travel times , countries can work together much more easily than was previously possible .
Corrected sentence : Additionally , business relations within the country have improved .
Today , it is relatively easy for American businesspeople to have business relations in any part of the world .
I have seen an increase in International Business during the past few decades .
Entertainment , a very large field , has grown since the invention of the airplane .
Corrected sentence : Now , entertainers , whether they are musicians , actors , or athletes , can travel from place to place much more quickly .
For example , Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid ; this was made much easier because of the airplane .
Professional athletic teams reduce travel time and are able to play more games in many different places because travel is so easy .
The last area I am going to touch on is intercontinental relations .
This area has been positively and negatively affected .
Positive aspects are those such as `` Peace Talks '' between nations ; these would not take place as often as they do if it took the President one week to get to where he or she was going .
Also , heads of state can more easily interact with each other ( in their respective countries ) with the use of air transportation .
Corrected sentence : There are negative aspects as well .
Corrected sentence : Unfortunately , airplanes have been used in wars .
Corrected sentence : The bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japan , for example , and the U.S. dropping atomic bombs on Japan .
The invention of the airplane has had many positive effects ; however , it has also brought about some negative changes .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , the number of cars is increasing while the number of public transport options is decreasing .
There are many pros and cons to using cars .
Corrected sentence : First of all , it is very useful .
You can drive anywhere and at any time . Secondly , it is more economical .
There is an opinion that discipline should prevail over talent in any job .
To my mind , I would not even question the statement . Corrected sentence : In my opinion , I would not even question the statement .
Firstly , only regular , consistent self-development ( which requires great discipline ) can turn a talent into a perfect skill in different professions .
Corrected sentence : No talent is worth anything without discipline .
It is common knowledge that even the most gifted and talented musicians or ballet dancers , for example , never succeed without orderly and hard work .
Even ballet dancers are known for their strict discipline .
Secondly , even if a person does not have any evident innate abilities , he or she can develop perfect skills ( provided there is discipline ) and become more impressive than a disorganized talent .
To add to this , the last World Hockey Championship showed how weak our Russian team ( stuffed with brilliant players ) was against a less talented but more disciplined American team .
Corrected sentence : However , not everyone shares my thoughts .
They say that if you are a genuine talent , discipline is unimportant because you already have talent , and that is enough .
They also believe that talent is the only thing that matters in artistic professions , and that if you are not gifted , no amount of discipline will help you .
I am afraid I can not agree with these people , as I think discipline is more important than talent ; only talent is never enough ; it needs support and day-to-day development .
As for creative professions , Pierre Cardin says that discipline and patience are in the first place for him .
I guess we can trust him .
To sum it up , the problem is twofold and complicated , but I still feel that discipline is the leading characteristic in any occupation .
Well , my first impression is that I absolutely disagree with the statement because , in my mind , public transport is much more convenient than cars or almost all other methods of travel , except for walking or biking .
The reason is simple . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no corrections are needed . )
Travelling represents energy ; therefore , if you must spend energy , it is more economical and environmentally friendly to transport many people with the same amount of energy .
You can also use better energy sources , such as electricity from solar or wind devices , with much greater profit through public transport than with a personal car , which may significantly reduce your level of greenhouse gases .
On the other hand , you may lack comfort or have poorer availability for any necessary travel , but the advantages of public transport over private transport are more significant than the disadvantages .
There were many objections raised against the introduction of the National Lottery when it was first proposed .
The main issue raised was the unemployment that would occur in the pool company industry .
As the lottery sounds more appealing due to the larger winnings , greater public interest , and the fact that it is easier to fill in than a pools coupon , fewer people would choose the pools coupon . This decrease in demand would mean that pools companies such as Littlewoods and Vernon would be forced to make employees redundant due to a decrease in profits .
There were also problems raised about addiction and people younger than sixteen obtaining phone numbers .
When the National Lottery was introduced , along with the scratch cards , many people became addicted to buying them . Most of these individuals were unemployed or poorly paid , and the Lottery represented a source of hope for future wealth . For many , this was not the case , and addiction led to large debts or resulted in violence and stealing to obtain extra money . It was argued that this addiction is on par with drug addiction and just as hard to overcome .
It was also argued that many people under the age of sixteen would buy lottery tickets , encouraging the whole nation and its youth to become compulsive gamblers , when money could be better spent on other products , such as extra food for the family , or saved for a holiday or a car .
There were also objections raised to the amount of money the proposed jackpot was to be each week and to the idea of rollovers increasing this figure even more .
Many people argued that the general public would not be able to cope with becoming overnight millionaires , and the untold pressure of fame on the front pages of tabloids , along with begging letters , would make many people crack . They would never lead a normal life again and would lose many friends .
Finally , the lottery was thought to put less money into charity collection boxes , as everyone would prefer to put their last pound on a lottery ticket rather than in a collection box .
Despite this , after a year of the National Lottery , there are many cases put forward for retaining it .
The main issue is the amount of money that goes towards research charities ; this was not the case at the start but was introduced later . Additionally , grants are given out to preserve our great country 's heritage and culture , such as extensive work to repair an existing art gallery .
Also , many sporting projects receive grants to build more recreational areas for youth and the public to express themselves , get them off the streets , and discipline them .
Another case for retaining it is the fact that people are still prepared to buy a ticket , and if the demand for a ticket is there , there is no reason why the supply should not also be .
It gives people hope and something to look forward to during the week . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
It has also increased the profits of many newsagents throughout the country , as they receive a small percentage of the money for each ticket sold .
There has been a literal explosion of inventions during the twentieth century , ranging from the garbage disposal to the A-bomb .
Some were created to make one 's life easier , others to make our lives longer ; all were created for the purpose of advancing civilization .
While each of these inventions has affected our lives in one way or another , some stand out as having significantly changed our mode of living .
Perhaps one does stand out a little more among its competition ; however , that is the television .
Before the late 1940s , entertainment , news , and information virtually all came through newspapers and radio .
A system that seemed to work was that many households throughout the nation owned or had access to a radio and/or a newspaper where they could easily and completely get the day 's information .
Corrected sentence : In the case of the radio , all was almost immediate .
Description of sporting events , voices acting out stories , and government officials speaking directly to the people made the radio seem like the perfect solution for countries with citizens living at all ends of their borders .
The advent of television changed all of that ; however , it gave the public a `` peek '' at what radio was n't able to provide .
Along with the news and information that the radio brought to the homes of people around the world , television was able to add images—pictures that enhanced the entire absorption of what was being broadcast .
Where once a reporter 's voice described a scene , now people can see for themselves what is happening because , for the most part , it is happening in front of their eyes .
Besides the obvious higher level of enjoyment that television watching may bring to its viewers , the most important aspect of this creation is its ability to bring the worlds together .
A president of one country can be seen and heard in a faraway country giving his views and ideas so that everyone can `` understand '' him .
The small-town store owner can watch her son in his Olympic race as it 's happening without spending thousands to travel to see him in person .
The examples could be endless . Corrected sentence : The examples could be endless . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
The strength of television must be recognized , however , as it has the power to reach many and persuade even more .
It is a multimillion-dollar business that has developed into even more facets of media , which have become a significant part of our lives .
It is a power we should be thankful to have , as long as we do just that : control it .
We can make television work for us in medicine , politics , education , and so much more , so it is necessary to remember to keep the vision in television .
In Brazil , the place where I have lived since I was born , we have a culture of practicing soccer .
In my country , soccer is the preference of almost everyone .
Today , my country is hosting the FIFA World Cup .
It 's the second time Brazil has hosted the World Cup event .
Last time was in 1950 , when Brazil lost the final to Uruguay in a packed Maracanã .
Corrected sentence : Millions of people expect Brazil to win the World Cup . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
The original phrase `` Environmental Problems '' is not a complete sentence , so it does n't contain grammatical errors in the traditional sense . However , if you are looking for a more complete and clear expression , you could say : Corrected sentence : `` There are many environmental problems that need to be addressed .
What will the future be like in 30 years ' time ?
We think that the planet will be in very bad condition and that the trees will be disappearing in 20 or 30 years due to deforestation . Humans will have more wars because water will be disappearing .
After that , the poles will have melted completely because the temperature of the sun will become extreme , and many people will have died from diseases , such as cancer .
The air pollution will be extreme because the cars will be flying down the streets and the technology will have totally changed .
Corrected sentence : Also in 20 years , we 'll be eating more fast food , and our anatomy will have changed .
Corrected sentence : So , before all of this becomes serious , we must begin to take care of our beautiful world .
For sure , traveling by car is more convenient ; however , I do n't agree with the first statement that claims there is no future for public transport for many reasons . First of all , cost is a significant factor . Secondly , the population requires more unification than before in order to reduce environmental violations and save our planet . Additionally , to enhance the chances of building good relationships among people using public transportation , we need to improve the vehicles that provide these services , including buses and train stations .
Dear TOEFL Staff , I am writing in response to your email concerning my TOEFL iBT test .
I decided to take the TOEFL IBT Test in order to apply to Copenhagen University and indicated the U.K. only as an option , but it is not my first choice .
Corrected sentence : Can I take the test anyway , or do I have to delete my reservation ?
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Abortion is a controversial topic in today 's society . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Corrected sentence : Almost everyone has an opinion on the subject . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Many people believe that it should be illegal .
Many others believe the government should not interfere ; it should remain a choice for the individual .
Corrected sentence : `` Haphazard poverty , personal choice , and illegal abortions are examples of why people should maintain their right to decide .
Abortion is a right of the people , and it should remain so .
One in four women experiences rape or attempted rape in their lifetime .
Imagine being forced to carry the child of a man who assaulted you and then being forced to give birth to this child .
Corrected sentence : Would you be able to love him or her ?
This traumatic event takes months or years to recover from . Corrected sentence : It takes months or years to recover from this traumatic event .
Without the right to an abortion , many of these women would require more time to recover and more counseling than they would already be receiving .
Most unwanted pregnancies occur in poverty-stricken areas of society .
Generally , children born into impoverished environments remain at that socioeconomic level their entire lives .
Lower-income families also tend to have an average of five children , while middle- and upper-income families tend to have only two children .
By offering abortion to lower-income individuals , you are helping to maintain a balance between the number of lower-income families and middle- and upper-income families .
Women deserve the right to have an abortion ; they won this right in the case of Roe v. Wade .
This was a landmark victory for pro-choice women across America .
Without this case , women would probably not be able to make the choice today .
No one should be able to decide whether another person should be allowed to have an abortion .
This includes religious people and the government itself , because if they remove this right , who is to say they will not try to remove other rights eventually ?
If abortion were to be outlawed again , would this end the practice ?
Corrected sentence : Not many women would continue to seek abortions , whether it be at some unsanitary underground `` clinic '' or on their own with some primitive tool like a coat hanger or a similar device .
Abortion would still be rampant , but now it would have a much higher mortality rate and be more expensive .
Without abortions , where would all the unwanted children go ?
The basic plan would be to put them in adoption homes , but this would cost taxpayers huge sums of money to support .
The average cost to support a child is one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars for eighteen years .
Infant mortality rates would skyrocket also because there would be a higher rate of ignorant and uncaring parents .
The education system in Iraq and Australia .
There is a big difference between Iraq and Australia in their education systems , and this stems from the different learning styles , as will be shown .
In Iraq , they still prefer the old learning styles , with schools providing basic knowledge based on the curricula . At the same time , they focus on homework . In contrast , in Australia , they emphasize indirect education through songs , painting , and stories , and they do n't prioritize homework because students complete all their duties at school .
I think the parents in Iraq care about their children 's future more than those in Australia because the level of education in Iraq determines their destiny , as the Iraqi people prefer formal jobs rather than freelance work .
Both Iraqis and an Australian believe that knowledge is gained through education , and it is not .
Hello , my name is Lucio , and I am from Mexico City .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , the environment is facing problems around the world , especially in my city , which is one of the biggest cities in the world . Four years ago , I made the decision to take action to save natural resources .
The first thing that I do every day is put a bucket behind me to collect the water that is wasted , which is then used to wash the yard .
The second thing that I do is have energy-saving bulbs in my entire house ; with this action , the contamination that affects my house is minimized . The last thing I do is close the faucet while I brush my teeth .
I can do more in favor of the environment , but at the moment , I am comfortable with the actions I take every day .
Travelling by motorway today is not as easy as it was meant to be by any standards ; yet , every morning and evening , motorways across the United Kingdom are blocked solid with traffic to and from work .
Not only is this ecologically unsound due to the harmful byproducts of the combustion engine , which have been stressed in the press recently , but it is also stressful , time-wasting , and expensive .
Earth has a finite supply of fossil fuels from which petroleum and diesel for our cars and trains are derived , but we have a need to get to work , which could be as much as 200 miles away .
Not only are there problems in traveling from A to B , but the likelihood is that if B is any major city , you will waste more time looking for somewhere to park there .
During pre-war Britain , rail was the only means of long-distance travel within the UK , and so the rail system was more efficient , with more frequent trains and many more stations . However , as the motor car became more popular , fewer people used the railroad , and the system declined . The smaller demand has led to less frequent services at an increased price .
In my opinion , the only way forward is the increased use of public transport systems because of the sheer waste caused by the average two-car family .
The majority of the cars that you will see while traveling at a 'snail 's ' pace along the M6 outside Birmingham will be driven by one person with no passengers . If these drivers had offered to give a colleague from work a lift home , the numbers on the road would effectively be halved .
Cities such as Manchester have tried hard to control the increasing numbers of cars by introducing by-passes and providing multi-storey car parking .
Some cities have even banned cars from entering the city during work hours , making pedestrian life more enjoyable .
Trams have been reestablished in some cities , allowing people to leave their cars to do their shopping .
This , in my opinion , is the attitude that should be adopted not only by town and city councils but also by the government to reduce the number of cars on the road .
Corrected sentence : It was as if it were her first day at school .
She stood before the great building and started searching for a clue that could help her overcome the feelings of uncertainty , desperation , and terrible curiosity that invaded her .
What was required of her ? Corrected sentence : What was required of her ? ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
How was she supposed to reach an agreement and establish a settlement with those beings that looked so much like humans but were not in the least similar to any other person she had ever known ?
They were not animals , they were not machines , and they were not automats , but they were ready to use her and give her back empty , with neither soul nor mind .
The original sentence `` She was there to negotiate the end of the war . '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : She was there to negotiate the end of the war .
She was alone , and they were millions .
They had crept unnoticed . Corrected sentence : They had crept without being noticed .
A whole civilization , soon to be lost , was fighting to survive , and its future was in her hands .
They owed her everything , and therefore they had admitted to receiving her , but would they listen to her words ?
She knew she would just tell lies—lots of lies , millions of lies—just as there were millions of beings with a reason to fight back : surveillance .
As she climbed the ruined stairs through the debris and filth , she noticed some pieces of corpses remaining nearby , and the smell was so disgusting that she thought she would puke at any moment .
Her watch showed 13:13 h ; that was a good hour , as good as any other .
The sun was shadowed by dark rose dust .
In today 's society , it is unrealistic for one to expect to work for a single company or to be employed by one for the entirety of their life .
This essay explains this statement from three perspectives : economic , sociological , and legal factors . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No corrections are needed . )
Workers do not gain maximum financial benefits if they work for a single company for a very long time . In order to attract more competent workers , companies tend to pay more to individuals who move from another company .
In Japan , for example , many workers conduct job hunting after spending several years at a company in order to get a better job at another company .
Except for those whose primary motivation for working is not money , one needs to consider working for several companies to achieve a better life .
One will be constantly exposed to degrading opinions from society if he or she stays at a single company for the entirety of his or her life ; some societies consider people who do not change companies to be less competent .
Again in Japan , because there is a social norm that competent workers constantly change jobs in order to get better positions , some people tend to see those who stay at a single company as lacking competence and being less ambitious .
Being very sensitive to how other people see us , we are less likely to work for a single company for a long time given today 's social standards .
Companies gain more benefits if they hire new employees for a short period .
Some countries require a company to hire an individual as a regular worker if they have worked for a specific number of years .
In Japan , for example , with the intention of securing jobs for the youth , companies are required to hire part-time workers as regular full-time workers after they have worked for more than four years .
This has been burdening some companies that are hiring only part-time workers for the sake of personnel costs ; as a result , many companies do not renew a work contract for more than four years .
Again , it is unrealistic for a worker to work for a single company for the rest of his or her life .
Everything happened three years ago . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
His father was very angry with him because Michael was n't the person he used to be .
Michael came back very late one night . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
He was associating with people who had a bad influence on him .
They drank every night and were out of control .
That day , Michael 's father talked to him and gave him one last opportunity to change .
At first , Michael was out of control . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
He started yelling at his father and hitting the furniture , so he was unable to hear what his father was saying .
Michael decided to leave because he did n't want to cause any more problems , but it was too late .
If his father had understood why Michael was acting this way , Michael 's father would have punished him severely .
So , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Corrected sentence : Hi , Isabel !
Corrected sentence : Where are you now ?
Corrected sentence : What are you doing in this moment ?
I 'm in Oxford , United Kingdom , with my best friend , and we are visiting the city .
Now is my new city , and I love it .
Oxford is a fantastic and old city in the UK .
There are many shops of any type .
My favorite store is Topshop , which sells clothes , and I like everything .
Here there are many interesting universities .
The food is n't good ; I miss the Italian food .
Corrected sentence : With lovely ale .
Dear Phillip ,
I 've received your letter and will respond to you as soon as possible .
You seem to be very upset because of these two interests .
I think you should n't give up anything you love .
They may exhaust you and give you no time to take a break .
I went through this during my high school years , so I can totally understand what you 're thinking .
I would rather give you some advice than take advantage of your time .
It 's better to schedule your daily events , as this can reduce the time you waste on activities like surfing the Net or watching TV . If you are still tired , try to take a rest .
It 's fine for a timeout , but not for a give-up .
I 'm pretty sure it will work if you are willing to give it a try .
Cheer up ! I will always be on your side .
Corrected sentence : ZUMBA , A HEALTHY AND FUN SPORT
If you want to keep fit , you must dance Zumba .
Actually , Zumba is one of the sports that you can find in all gyms .
It is a sport in which people move their entire bodies as they dance to different kinds of music .
Corrected sentence : Usually , one session of Zumba lasts around 60 minutes , during which you can burn approximately 600 calories .
Corrected sentence : Also , you do exercise , and at the same time , you are fine .
Moreover , practicing Zumba is an opportunity to meet other people and make new friends .
It is a sport that everyone can train in : children , women , and men . It is also considered a sport that makes people happy because they learn many challenging dances , see changes in their bodies , look healthy , and thus improve their self-esteem .
If you do Zumba three times a week and follow a healthy diet , you will lose weight and feel better .
Furthermore , I would like to advise that before each session , you must warm up your muscles to avoid any injury or problem . You should begin carefully because there are very fast songs , and you could get hurt .
Also , you will need a lot of water to drink .
On the other hand , if you feel tired , you can rest for a while .
To rest during a song is better than trying to dance to all the songs and ending up injured .
In addition , after each session , you may stretch your body very well , and thus , the next day you wo n't feel the horrible stiffness .
You have to practice Zumba because it is very fun . You will be the king or queen of the disco .
My city does not have good transport .
We only have one bus , and the system is not good .
They are late , and there are very many people .
The government should invest more money in the system to improve it .
Corrected sentence : If the politicians use the money more correctly , the situation will be much better .
Unfortunately , I can not say that my city is truly nature-protective .
The city is quite clean , but all the garbage is transported to scrapyards and stored there .
Some of it was burned down , but most of the garbage remains forever .
Well , not forever maybe , but garbage remains on collectors for an indefinite amount of time .
Several years ago , special garbage containers had appeared in my city .
These containers have several sections for different types of waste .
But when a container becomes full , the dustcart operator pours all the garbage into the same trunk !
So naturally , people were not happy to see that , and less than a month later , all those containers were abandoned .
The next major problem with environmental protection is industrial waste .
There 's a river in our city that is heavily poisoned by industrial pollution .
Today , all factories have filtering systems , but swimming in our river is still forbidden .
Corrected sentence : Nevertheless , I want to say that our city is changing .
These changes are not being implemented quickly , but they are in progress .
I hope that in a couple of years , I 'll be able to say that the city is really clean .
Corrected sentence : People have always seen themselves as social animals , with living together being the norm .
Family life is one of the foundations of how we understand ourselves and our relationships , as well as the way we build our places to live .
In this essay , I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different generations of one family living together in the same house .
In my opinion , there are more advantages , but the worst thing that can happen is the generation gap , which is one of the reasons why relationships between teenagers and parents or grandparents can be difficult sometimes .
On the other hand , there is nothing better than getting along well together , especially with people you can rely on and trust .
They are your family , and you are sharing your time and space with them , so if you feel involved , your life will be easier .
All you need are good communication skills and empathy .
You can help each other when necessary , ask for a piece of advice , and be able to take part in reasoned discussions .
There are some ways to prevent problems and ways to avoid upsetting each other .
The original sentence `` It is important to keep an open mind . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : It is important to keep an open mind .
When we act like that , we will find that all of us not only survive but also thrive .
Finally , family living should be nurtured and supported by all family members because unity is our strength .
Corrected sentence : A good deed .
It was a nice Saturday night in Madrid . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
I was in the Plenilunio with my friends like any 15-year-old adolescent .
When we were leaving the shopping center , I unexpectedly found a really weird handbag ; I was shocked by the situation .
Finding a bag with jewelry is not a mundane situation . Corrected sentence : Finding a bag filled with jewelry is not a mundane situation .
When I took the bag to see if there were any documents or something that could help me find the owner , my friends were turning a blind eye to me .
I quickly took the bag and left the shopping center surreptitiously while I was looking for my friends .
As I could n't find them , I directly went home as if nothing had happened .
When I reached my bedroom , I saw that the exotic boxes I thought carried jewelry actually contained banknotes .
I actually thought it was a dream ; when I reacted , I had been quiet as a mouse for 2 minutes .
The original sentence `` What should I do ? '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : What should I do ?
I take the money and act as if nothing has occurred , or I try to give the bag back .
Finally , my regrets convinced me to do a good deed .
Corrected sentence : While researching for something that would help me return the money , I found the number of someone we were actually going to meet when I encountered him on the street .
Corrected sentence : It was my neighbor !
I gave him the bag and , proud of myself , I went back home thinking about what would have happened if I , selfishly , had kept the money .
The question of a single Europe and whether it implies a loss of sovereignty for Britain has been a subject of considerable debate for some time .
Last November , one of the principal reasons underlying Mrs. Thatcher 's resignation was her negative stance against increasing involvement in Europe .
Her views were not shared by many of her party colleagues who , on the contrary , were conscious of an all-too-pressing need for Britain to play an active role in a united Europe .
Corrected sentence : January 1993 is expected to witness the creation of the single European market .
The aim of such a union is essentially economic .
All trade barriers will be broken down to encourage and promote free trade between the countries of Europe , with the belief that increased cooperation will lead to increased productivity .
In order to facilitate trade between the different nations , many people are in favor of adopting a common currency , namely the ECU .
This , in turn , would also have to lead to the formation of a central European bank .
A single Europe , while primarily created as an economic union , will necessarily have implications at a political level .
The European Parliament , of course , already exists , but many people envisage that in a single Europe it will play a more important role and its power will be extended , possibly surpassing that exercised by individual national governments in Europe and overriding decisions made by them .
For supporters of a single Europe , the question of whether it will entail a loss of British sovereignty is not a primary issue . They would argue , first and foremost , that Britain can not afford to go it alone and that it is in her interests to join forces with the rest of Europe .
Critics of the European Union , on the other hand , are afraid that increased cooperation in both the economic and political spheres will give rise to a European superpower that will undermine Britain 's sovereignty in these areas .
Personally , I am in favor of a single Europe to the extent that I believe Britain can no longer afford to stand alone in opposition to the other countries in Europe , all of which have long been in favor of such a union .
Moreover , closer cooperation will undoubtedly be favorable and will bring about increased productivity and prosperity .
However , I feel hesitant about the prospect of a common currency , at least until the time when such a move might become necessary , as this would certainly mean the loss of British sovereignty from an economic point of view .
Yet I am even more opposed to the idea of listening to political dictates from Brussels .
If the powers of the European Parliament are extended to the point that it has authority over national governments , our whole democratic political structure will be in grave danger , and Britain will assuredly lose its political sovereignty .
Academic culture differs from one country to another ; therefore , it is the most important and challenging task for international students to adjust to the academic culture of Australia for effective learning .
During my studies , I have found a vast difference in academic culture between Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal , memorizing lessons and rote learning are the basis of higher education .
In contrast , in Australia , students are supposed to use online resources for research , reference , study independently , and think critically .
At the beginning , I felt really uncomfortable using online resources , finding it difficult to develop my own perspective and present a reasoned argument .
However , studying in Australian academic culture is an incredibly exciting and rewarding experience .
There are definite reasons for the difference in the academic cultures of Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal , university teachers hardly get training , orientation , and research opportunities to update their knowledge ; therefore , they stick with the traditional method of teaching .
The original sentence appears to be a citation rather than a complete sentence , which makes it difficult to identify grammatical errors . However , if we assume that the intention is to present a citation correctly , we can format it properly.Corrected sentence : Teijlingen , E. , & Simkhada , P. ( 2010 ) .
As a result , the students fail to access research literature despite their strong academic achievements .
On the other hand , in Australia , courses like EAP are usually designed to improve students ' academic language proficiency and the relevant study skills that will help them throughout their academic lives .
It seems that the sentence you provided is incomplete or lacks context . If `` Budley '' is meant to be a name or a subject , please provide the full sentence for me to identify and correct any grammatical errors . Once I have the complete sentence , I can help you generate a corrected version .
Thus , skill-based learning is more useful in our academic lives .
In conclusion , for my effective learning at my university , I will access available resources for my research , improve my note-taking skills , interact with teachers and peers in class , attend lectures , and work hard to be an independent learner .
Corrected sentence : Among recent issues , there have been significant problems caused by the number of heavy goods vehicles on British roads today .
This amount of traffic on the roads causes mass congestion on motorways such as the M25 in London and the M61 into Manchester . This static movement on British motorways has led to an increase in gas emissions from car exhausts into the atmosphere , which will eventually contribute to global warming .
A few suggestions have been made to remedy these problems , but they have had no great effect .
Corrected sentence : Several of these are listed below .
An allowance of better access into Britain 's main industrial centers by the building of large and substantial highways .
A limited number of H.G.V . operators are only submitting a few lorries from their fleet to be used on British roads .
A kind of catalytic converter for diesel engines that reduces some of the harmful emissions .
Another idea is for the government to introduce some type of tolling system to be used on motorways and main A roads .
A final approach to the problem of congestion on motorways is to make heavy goods transport compulsory by rail only .
Here are only a few suggestions on how to convert British roads , but just these few would be cause for debate .
The problem with these suggestions is that it would cost millions of pounds to put any one of them into practice .
Take the first suggestion , for example : a network of routes into all major industrial cities would cost billions , due to the fact that it costs £1 million a mile of motorway .
If there were only a limited number of H.G.V . operators , it would drive a lot of people out of business , and that would n't be in the best interest of the government .
A catalytic converter for diesel engines is a good idea , but it would only reduce gas emissions and not congestion .
All the suggestions I have made have problems , and this is why we still have issues on our roads today .
Dear Sirs and Madams ,
My name is Edda Preuß ; I am from Germany , and I finished my A-levels this year .
To gain some new inspiration and ideas about what I would like to do in the future , I planned to take a road trip through the USA .
Corrected sentence : But my plans suddenly changed when I read your advertisement for the job at the summer camp .
I am a very open-minded person .
I love traveling and exploring different cultures .
Furthermore , I do many sports , such as swimming , running , and dancing Flamenco , Zumba , and Hip Hop .
I have already worked with children in the past , as I was a swimming teacher for children aged 4 to 7 years and also completed an internship at a primary school in my town .
I loved organizing all sorts of activities , parties , and meals .
I hope you share my opinion that I am the perfect employer for the job you are offering .
I am looking forward to meeting you personally .
Corrected sentence : Best regards ,
It seems that `` Edda Preuß '' is a name and does not contain any grammatical errors . If you intended to provide a different sentence for correction , please share it , and I would be happy to help !
Dear Madam/Sir ,
I was pleased to see your report on municipal waste collection released recently , as I have long been interested in the data you published . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
It was also great to see that the percentage of land-filled waste is lower compared to other regions , and I was particularly glad to see that the utilization of waste to recover heat and power has at least started , even if its proportion is still negligible in the overall treatment of waste .
It is my firm conviction that the proportion of recycled waste needs to grow during the coming year ( s ) while reducing the amount of land-filled waste to avoid the detrimental effects it has on the health conditions of the local population .
Due to this , I would like to propose that you involve locally based companies in decision-making , since they are likely to have a stake in maintaining a clean local environment and are eager to utilize recycled raw materials for their manufacturing processes .
It is imperative that you take my proposal into serious consideration because the growing number of illnesses caused by toxic waste in the soil increases the municipality 's social security expenditures and ruins the lives of local families .
The sentence `` Yours sincerely , '' is already grammatically correct as it is a standard closing for a letter . There are no errors to correct . Corrected sentence : Yours sincerely ,
It seems that `` Carlo Paole '' is not a complete sentence and does not contain any grammatical errors as it appears to be a name . If you intended to provide a longer sentence or context for correction , please share that , and I would be happy to help !
Genetic manipulation has been occurring for many centuries in the form of selective breeding of both crops and animals .
This technique has greatly benefited the human race by enabling the production of more food , better food , and new and interesting varieties of food .
Of course , it is not just food that has benefited from selective breeding ; the development of different natural fibers , such as wool and cotton , has been aided by it .
It is only in very recent times that genetic manipulation has been seen to have both bad and good sides .
This is because we are now at a stage where scientists can alter an organism by changing its genes in some way .
I do not believe that the scientists who originally began research into the nature of genetics had any idea that it would one day be put to bad ( or good ) use ; they simply wanted to find out what it was all about and therefore can not be blamed for any later events .
Today , much research is being carried out on human genes to find out how they work and whether they can be altered to prevent diseases .
The scientists who work on this can not be blamed if someone else uses their technique for less philanthropic ends—for example , in biological warfare , or to eliminate a 'gay ' or 'criminal ' gene that may be present in human embryos .
Corrected sentence : Where scientists can be blamed , however , is in the case of genetically engineered tomatoes . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
These are now available in a supermarket near you , with their genes altered to increase their redness , juiciness , or resistance to disease .
These tomatoes are probably perfectly safe , but if they , or some other genetically engineered food , prove to cause a terrible disease , then that is the fault of the scientists who developed them , because they did not test them adequately to make sure they were safe .
Similarly , if genetically engineered vaccines or medicines prove to have harmful side effects , it is because they were not adequately tested before being released into the market , and the scientists are to blame .
Corrected sentence : To whom it may concern ,
I am writing this letter because I believe I am a suitable candidate for this job .
I love working with kids , and I have a lot of experience taking care of them as well as organizing different activities .
I love working in the kitchen , and I am an excellent cook .
The sentence `` Sincerely , '' is already grammatically correct as it is typically used as a closing in a letter or email . However , if you are looking for a complete sentence or context , you might consider adding a subject or context . For example : Original : Sincerely , Corrected : Sincerely , [ Your Name ] If you meant to provide a different sentence for correction , please share it , and I will be happy to help !
It seems that the sentence provided is incomplete , as it only contains the name `` Natalia . '' Please provide a complete sentence that contains grammatical errors , and I will be happy to help you identify and correct them .
Corrected sentence : Everyone knows that famous people have a hard life .
Corrected sentence : They are constantly on our minds , at the center of attention .
Famous people do not actually have personal time . Corrected sentence : Famous people often do not have personal time .
Corrected sentence : Is it correct ?
In my opinion , `` no . '' I think these people deserve freedom .
Corrected sentence : Celebrities have 2 lives .
Corrected sentence : First , life is for society and the press .
Corrected sentence : Second Life is private , without cameras or journalists .
Corrected sentence : Like any normal person , these people want to rest and find silence after a hard day .
Sometimes journalists are waiting for their `` victims '' around houses and restaurants .
Corrected sentence : It is not very nice . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
Corrected sentence : Often , they are asked dirty and unpleasant questions .
Famous people also want to spend time with family and friends .
I think to solve this problem , we need to indicate the time and place where the famous person will give the interview .
Police can arrest journalists if they take interviews in the wrong place .
Corrected sentence : Then I think this would facilitate the lives of famous people .
For one thing , they are people , not machines .
The National Lottery was introduced to Britain in November 1994 . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Since the first draw , it has become increasingly popular , involving millions of people across the country each week .
The proposal of a lottery brought about many objections and complaints .
There were , and still are , two principal concerns that the Anti-National Lottery Campaigners still have .
For people living in high society , a 'flutter ' on the National Lottery each week has no effect on their financial position .
Corrected sentence : These kinds of people can afford to spend £10 to £20 a week .
The concern lies with the , and I use the term lightly , 'working-class citizens ' .
These people work hard throughout the year and can not afford to spend large amounts of money on the lottery .
The problem is that these working men and women , as well as unemployed men and women , spend money they ca n't afford .
The second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling . Corrected sentence : The second of the two problems is encouraging gambling .
The National Lottery , after all , is another gambling game .
The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million , and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58 .
It is gambling , but more importantly , it is gambling made available to 16-year-olds .
A lot of gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery .
These can be easily purchased , and the attraction allows for winning on the spot .
The thought of being rich instantly encourages gamblers , both young and old , as well as those who are underage , to purchase tickets .
The National Lottery , however , has its good points .
There is one main advantage to playing the lottery .
It has helped charities and societies around the country achieve things that would otherwise have been impossible .
From buying a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment for a young child with brain problems to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland Islands , the lottery has helped both young and old , far and wide .
The lottery has also created jobs , encouraged spending , and made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like to be rich .
The National Lottery has its good points and its bad points .
Deciding whether it should have been introduced or not is very much a personal matter and depends on how highly you rate the points I have emphasized in this essay .
I believe it is a benefit to the country .
Dear Student Film Club ,
I thought I might help you choose an awesome movie for the club .
Corrected sentence : It is actually a thriller .
I absolutely loved this one because of its amazing actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Blake Lively .
They played a married couple in their early thirties who had just moved to a lake house .
Of course , after a few weeks , strange things started happening .
At night , they heard weird noises and moans coming from the lake .
Furthermore , the woman started to see shadows and movements around the water .
Corrected sentence : It only got worse .
I do n't want to give you a huge spoiler and ruin everything , so I am only going to tell you that it will get pretty intense .
Someone is going to die , and there is going to be a lot of blood .
I highly recommend watching this thriller .
Corrected sentence : If you have the guts , you will love it just as much as I did .
Corrected sentence : Until next time , Lea . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
Hi Jo ,
I am so glad to hear from you .
I am very happy because you decided to come to my city .
This is a great idea because it means we can spend some time together .
Corrected sentence : First of all , I would like to know how you are going to travel .
From your city to mine , you can travel by plane , train , or bus ; whatever you choose , you have connections to the center of the city . However , for me , the fastest way is traveling by plane .
From the airport , there are different modes of transport , such as buses , trains , or the underground , and they take you to the city in less than half an hour .
Travelling within the city is quite expensive ; however , if you get a one-day travel card , you will save money .
Although getting a job is quite harder than last year , many agencies are looking for employees just for the summer .
You can try to get a job as a waitress in fast food restaurants or as a retail assistant in shopping centers .
Corrected sentence : I hope this helps you .
Corrected sentence : See you later .
The author uses a third-person narrator , which employs third-person pronouns such as `` his '' or `` their .
The story is told through the eyes of Susan .
The narrator knows her feelings and thoughts and is able to see what she sees , but she does not know any of the thoughts or feelings of the other characters .
One point that shows this is the scene in which Susan talks to Annie , and she wonders what Annie might think about her plan to save the dog .
From all these points , one can conclude that the narrator has a limited point of view .
Another point that needs to be analyzed is the mode of presentation .
In the short story , we can mostly find a scenic presentation .
The events are described in detail , for example , when every step of Susan 's is described .
There is only one exception in which the mode of presentation is panoramic : when the events of the holidays are summed up in the second paragraph .
Furthermore , the story is made up of parts of external action and parts of internal action , such as the interior monologue , where the reader gets to know all of Susan 's thoughts in detail .
Save Billy is a short story that is written in an informal register , which can be recognized by the use of informal words such as `` kiddies '' and short forms like `` did n't '' and `` is n't .
The aim of this study is to verify the research trends in the Revista Educação Especial during the years 2010 to 2013 and identify the most developed research themes in recent years ; it also identifies undeveloped or absent themes in the last four years .
The selection of the journal is justified because it is a journal with wide-ranging coverage that publishes only articles on Special Education .
This is a bibliographic research study of qualitative and quantitative data .
The articles analyzed were accessed from the journal site , resulting in 134 articles .
The collected information was organized into frameworks outlining developed themes and pointing out the number of articles discussing each subject . It was also tabulated to include the institution and whether the article presented participants or not , as well as who the participants were .
The results showed that the institutions publishing more in the journal are the Universidade Federal de São Carlos and the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria . The majority of the research does not present participants , followed by the items with interventions made by professionals .
The most published topics are Special Education and School Inclusion , while the least published are prevention and defining disability .
Corrected sentence : I noticed that some disabilities are poorly studied or do not present effective interventions . For example , in the case of global developmental disorders , there is a great concern to work with autism , but little or almost nothing is presented on the other conditions that fall within this group .
Another example is in relation to the articles dealing with the issue of deafness , specifically one that we can verify from the twelve associated with cochlear implantation .
The doorbell rang . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
When I opened the door , imagine my surprise when I saw Maria Shaw , my favorite singer , in front of me .
She looked as beautiful as I had seen her in the clips , but she seemed a bit worried .
I need help ; I am completely lost , and I need to get to Valencia .
Furthermore , my car is broken , '' she said , and I replied , `` There 's no problem .
Corrected sentence : I 'm going to take you to your concert .
It was very exciting because nobody had visited me at my cottage , but that day my luck changed .
In my journey with Maria , I asked her a lot of questions .
She was very friendly and made a lot of jokes to me .
She invited me to the concert , and it was wonderful . I had tried to buy tickets , but it was impossible because they had been sold in less than an hour .
The best moment of the night was when she dedicated a song to me , and later , she invited me to supper with all her staff .
What a marvelous woman I met that day !
I think many people use cars for traveling because it is easy , but when you are on the road with your own car , there are a lot of disadvantages .
Corrected sentence : One of these is traffic : if you take the tube , you will probably not stay in traffic for minutes , and you will move faster underground .
For me , people almost did n't find the real potential of public transport .
Many of them think that moving with their own car is better .
The high number of cars is really damaging to the environment , and the pollution increases every day .
I hope that there will be a future for public transport that is more effective than cars .
I think there are advantages and disadvantages to having a car .
An advantage is that you can go anywhere you want with your car , but a big disadvantage is the traffic .
Another disadvantage is finding a parking space for the car in the center of cities .
Public transport also has advantages and disadvantages .
Corrected sentence : For example , public transport has designated stops , and sometimes there is a slight delay .
Corrected sentence : But a big advantage , especially for the underground , is the absolute absence of traffic .
Old computers were much bigger and more complicated to handle than recent models .
They could n't access the Internet because there simply was no such thing .
You had to command the device by typing instructions in specific ways that few people knew how to .
There were n't any mice , and it was impossible to connect anything wirelessly .
One could only play a small number of games on old computers .
Corrected sentence : All of these features did not make computers very popular among common people ; instead , they were used almost exclusively by scientists and mathematicians .
Corrected sentence : Nobody uses them nowadays !
They were far less practical and comfortable than our current everyday devices .
In fact , there is no future for public transportation .
As far as public transport is concerned , there does not seem to be a way forward unless we can reduce the enormous amounts of petrol needed to fuel it .
In my view , the type of transport to which we are accustomed will gradually diminish .
On the other hand , the vehicle industry has managed to create efficient electric cars , as they do not need petrol .
This is a huge advance for the environment and also a huge problem for the development of public transport .
It can be seen that each year there are more and more new electric models from Toyota and other brands .
Far from being only a benefit for the environment , this fact is also positive for the travelers who will experience a significant reduction in travel costs with this new type of car , which is causing a direct decrease in the use of public transport .
At this point , something seems clear to the public transport industry : its future depends on how it will be able to obtain more efficient trains , buses , or planes .
Corrected sentence : Why is that ?
There are two reasons : price and environmental protection .
Yesterday , I was at the beach with my grandpa and my dog , Willi .
Willi is a two-year-old beautiful poodle , which I got as a Christmas present .
Corrected sentence : Well , Willi likes hunting , so my grandpa threw his stick into the water . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
Immediately , Willi turned and ran for the stick .
He was back in a minute .
Corrected sentence : Then a strange man came to see us .
He was tall and slim , and he was wearing a coat .
He kept a stick in his hand , but his was bigger than my grandpa 's .
As he saw Willi , he threw his stick into the water too and wanted Willi to bring it back .
Corrected sentence : But he did n't want to catch the man 's stick , so he turned around and walked away .
Of course , we left with him .
The man was shouting at us to return for a minute , but then he stopped .
The stick was still lying on the water , so he had no choice but to jump into the water for it .
Although the man was angry , it was very funny for us .
Corrected sentence : Do you agree or disagree with the statement ?
The more money people have , the more they should give away to charity .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , more and more people discuss whether it is a responsibility of a person who possesses more money to help others .
Corrected sentence : Donate more money to charity .
Corrected sentence : Some people think that the more money a rich man has , the more useless it is , so he should give it away .
Corrected sentence : He gave away a portion of his fortune for charity .
By doing this , he can use them to their maximum effect . I can not agree .
Corrected sentence : With this idea .
There are numerous reasons to support me . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Money can be used not only to donate to charity but also to have a perfect daily life .
Corrected sentence : If we want to live , we must make better choices .
To correct the grammatical error in the given sentence , we need to clarify the structure and ensure it flows properly . The word `` longer '' at the beginning seems out of context . Corrected sentence : `` To live longer , we have to maintain a happy mindset every day .
Corrected sentence : To maintain a happy mindset , someone should shop every day .
It seems that the provided sentence `` When they '' is incomplete and lacks context . To correct it , I would need more information or a complete thought . However , if we assume you want a complete sentence , here ’ s an example : Original : When they Corrected sentence : When they arrived at the party , everyone was already dancing.If you have a specific sentence in mind , please provide it , and I can help correct it !
Corrected sentence : When they see what they want to buy , they buy it without the slightest hesitation .
Corrected sentence : Therefore , they can be happy .
Corrected sentence : Life is experienced every day .
In addition to buying what you want , money can also be used to build a more wonderful world . Corrected sentence : In addition to buying what you want , it can also be used to build a more wonderful world .
Corrected sentence : There are many options .
Corrected sentence : diseases that can not be cured .
Corrected sentence : Therefore , a rich man can use his fortune to build a group that is made up of the
Corrected sentence : An excellent biological scientist is needed to research new , useful medicines to help save more dying people .
Furthermore , giving away money for charity is not a privilege reserved only for rich people ; common people can also contribute .
Corrected sentence : Donate money to a philanthropic organization .
Some people think living a plain life is the best thing for them .
Therefore , the common people contribute a portion of their fortunes to charity and simply live a general life .
It is unclear what the complete sentence is , as `` It is '' appears to be an incomplete thought . Please provide the full sentence for me to identify and correct any grammatical errors .
Corrected sentence : They are so kind that they have great lives every day .
Corrected sentence : Dear Mrs. Ashby ,
I am writing to apply for the position of COOK , as seen in your advertisement .
I am a 25-year-old girl , and I am a student .
The original sentence `` I love cooking . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I love cooking .
I am interested in many exotic cultures , for example , Chinese and Japanese food .
Corrected sentence : `` Was it drawing us to Facebook ?
More than 500 million users log on to the site every day , but many of them bemoan Facebook as a time suck , although they could spend this time more productively on work , schoolwork , or real face time with family and friends .
But something keeps drawing us in : the fueling of Facebook can boost our self-esteem , satisfy our need for connectedness and self-promotion , and help us maintain offline relationships .
But we do n't use Facebook in the same way ; there are the sociable , the lonely , and the narcissistic , and they go on Facebook to satisfy different needs .
The University psychologist Stefan Hofmann found out that we use Facebook to satisfy two needs .
On the one hand , we need to belong , and on the other , we need self-presentation .
Facebook satisfies both of those basic needs , according to Hofmann .
Some people think that Facebook is a blessing for interpersonal connections .
But other people think Facebook makes us lonely and removes our contact with real friends .
Corrected sentence : In Social Psychology , Sheldon finds that spending a lot of time on Facebook is associated with both high levels of feeling connected to other people and high levels of disconnection .
A new study suggests that we gain some psychological benefits even from passively viewing our own profiles .
In a 2011 study of about 300 college students , researchers Amy Gonzales and Jeffrey Hancock found that students who were asked to look at their own Facebook page for just three minutes showed a boost in self-esteem compared with control groups who either looked in a mirror or simply sat in a room for three minutes .
The researchers suspect this is due to the fact that we can self-select what other people can see on our profile .
Facebook can allow people to access information that they would n't otherwise know , such as a new job opportunity or a news story they might have missed .
The more different kinds of people you have in your network , the better your chances of getting useful information .
Researchers believe that social networking is likely to continue growing .
The doorbell rang . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
When I opened the door , I imagined my surprise .
The original sentence `` I was shocked . '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I was shocked .
He looked like Luke Guina . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
I wondered how that could really be . Corrected sentence : I wondered how that could actually be .
I looked at him , and he looked at me .
I was totally sure .
He sang in my favorite band .
I cried , `` Oh my fucking god , you are Luke Guina , right ? I am probably your biggest fan !
Corrected sentence : How can it be that I met you at our school ?
I have been to so many concerts , and I have never had the chance to speak to you .
He laughed and answered , `` Wow , I did n't think anybody knew me in this school .
Well , my band is not very famous right now , but thank you for the compliments .
I am really glad for them .
I will go to school here starting now . We had a nice conversation , and I finally found a very good friend in Luke .
I love the music of his band , and maybe I will be part of the group as a second singer .
The original sentence `` I would like to write about my family . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I would like to write about my family .
I am a mother of two grown-up children .
I am a part-time employee working in a laboratory as a Specimen Receptionist .
The original sentence `` I have been working there for almost nine years . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I have been working there for almost nine years .
I came to the United Kingdom in 2004 with my husband and my children .
My husband came here as a student to study for his PhD . At the beginning , I was the only one who earned money in the family .
Corrected sentence : Because of this , it was hard to provide daily necessities for our young children .
At that time , my daughter was a teenager .
Initially , she had to struggle to adjust herself to a completely new environment .
But I am happy to say that after ten years of hardship , my husband managed to find a proper job , and my daughter has also become a sensible , smart woman . At the moment , she is studying for a degree in developmental physiology .
Dear Grace ,
You had a serious accident that changed your life forever .
It 's normal to feel depressed now and to think that life is not worth living anymore , but you must consider all the beautiful things you can still do , even if you have to do them in a different way .
You need to think positively and try to enjoy yourself . Do n't think about the past ; just live your life in the present . Do n't be discouraged , and do n't let this problem change your life .
Even if it seems impossible to be optimistic , it depends only on you ; you need to want it .
In order to determine whether crime pays , one should first define what is meant by the word `` pays .
If a person gains $ 100 from a jewelry store theft , yet uses ten dollars ' worth of gas to get away , cuts his hand on a broken window and pays $ 50 in medical bills , and spends another $ 50 for a hotel room to hide in , then his crime has actually left him ten dollars in the hole .
However , the question of whether crime pays requires a deeper level of `` pay '' than simple dollars and cents accounting .
In terms of criminal work , pay must be weighed against the gains made from crime versus all forms of loss that occur as a result .
One issue to consider as a loss is the type of capital loss illustrated above . Corrected sentence : One issue to consider as a loss is the type of capital loss that is illustrated above .
Corrected sentence : Crime , like any small business , requires investment .
Corrected sentence : One investment is time .
If the time involved in the planning and execution of a crime does not result in a gain that can justify that time expenditure , then the crime has not paid off .
Whether or not crime pays in this instance depends on how much money a criminal can make in a legitimate field .
If the criminal can only expect to earn minimum wage in a legal job , then they can earn less from crimes to justify the time spent .
If a criminal is well-educated and can function in one of the professions , then his crimes must earn more .
Other capital investments in crime could include equipment such as getaway cars , dynamite , weaponry , and disguises .
Mafia and police payoffs could be involved .
Dealing in stolen property or other contraband could require splitting the money earned with other involved parties .
A crime 's income must be sufficient to cover all these expenditures .
Another type of loss to be considered is the loss of mental or physical health and well-being .
Many times , violence is a part of crime .
The cost of a gunshot or knife wound to the leg is more than just the medical bills .
It could be an injury that keeps someone from ever being able to work again .
Very few criminals have workers ' compensation .
The stress that comes from the constant risk of injury and incarceration is a cost in itself and could lessen both a person 's lifespan and enjoyment of life .
Legal problems could result in both a capital loss and a health-related loss .
Lawyers can be very expensive , and if a criminal chooses to avoid the financial burden of a more expensive attorney , he may pay with the loss of health from being imprisoned .
Even if someone is not imprisoned , long legal entanglements can be very stressful and unhealthy . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
Corrected sentence : Does crime pay ? ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
In some cases , it may , but the small businessman who is a criminal must deal with the same risks as the legitimate businessman .
Larger criminal corporations will always seek to drive him out of business , and he may have to work long hours for small gains . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
However , he does better than the legitimate businessman on one count : no taxes .
In my hometown of Kalamazoo , the invention of the shopping mall has changed the lives of the people in our town and the town itself .
While many people enjoy and utilize shopping malls , I believe that they are more of a detriment than a blessing .
Kalamazoo , like most American cities , began to surround the central means of transportation .
Cities were first located near water , then near train tracks , and later began to locate themselves farther away due to the invention of trucks and cars .
Corrected sentence : Downtown Kalamazoo was once a thriving and successful area .
Near the train station were the larger industries and other essential specialized stores for everyday supplies .
Homes and neighborhoods were located outside of the central city ; however , many stores had several floors of apartments above them to accommodate families living there .
Corrected sentence : Everyone was near the central city , so they could all use it .
Rich and poor alike have easy access to the offerings of the central city .
Throughout history , the trend has been for the rich to get richer and the poor to remain poor .
While the rich got richer , they began to build specialized shops and strip malls outside the city limits .
Corrected sentence : And the wealthier moved from the inner city ( with help from the invention of the automobile ) to the suburbs , where they could keep a distance from the busy inner city .
While the wealthier began moving away from the inner city , the poor and lower working class remained due to a lack of transportation or money to move outward .
This process has left the businesses in the inner cities , including Kalamazoo , without a stable clientele .
Why should we , say those with cars , go downtown where the poorer people are and have to shop outside , going from specialized store to specialized store , when I can go to a nice indoor mall that has everything ?
Businesses that could move out of the downtown district did , and still do , relocate to strip malls near the main malls or in the malls themselves .
I believe it is only the storeowners who realize this process is occurring or who enjoy the downtown district that remain and stay in business .
Many larger factories and office buildings still remain downtown .
Corrected sentence : The executives and business people rely on commuting to and from the city daily without taking advantage of what was once a thriving neighborhood .
Corrected sentence : `` It still could be !
Corrected sentence : One feature that does attract businesses is colleges .
Kalamazoo has one large university , one private college , and two community colleges .
It seems that the provided sentence is incomplete , as it only contains the word `` colleges . '' To correct it , I would need more context or a complete sentence . However , if we assume you meant to write a complete thought about colleges , here ’ s an example of a corrected sentence : Original : `` colleges . '' Corrected sentence : `` Colleges play a significant role in higher education . `` If you have a specific sentence in mind , please provide it , and I can help correct it !
The large private universities are within walking distance of downtown Kalamazoo , so many businesses try to cater to our tastes—clubs , cafés , and other stores .
Another attempt to reinstate success is the downtown festivals .
Corrected sentence : We have many attractions , and they always attract people from the suburbs .
This disintegration of the inner city is detrimental to the people it affects : the poor and the lower middle class .
There are neighborhoods that do n't receive financial support , and money is not spent in the stores near them .
If they could have more money and leave , the majority would do so .
Shopping malls , strip malls , and the flight of upper-class Americans from the inner cities will only hurt those who ca n't escape in the end ; in fact , it already is hurting businesses and lives in the downtown districts .
The original sentence `` Hello . '' is already grammatically correct . There are no errors to correct . Corrected sentence : Hello .
Firstly , I would like to introduce myself . I am 32 years old , and I come from Poland .
The first time I checked this website , I thought it was too difficult .
Corrected sentence : For me , but today I will also try to write something using this .
It seems that the provided sentence is incomplete , as it only contains the word `` website . '' To assist you effectively , please provide a complete sentence that contains grammatical errors .
I chose this subject , but I do n't have any idea what I should write .
It seems that the sentence you provided is incomplete . If you could provide a full sentence , I would be happy to help identify and correct any grammatical errors .
Maybe I will try to write something to you about myself .
Corrected sentence : What I do in my life and why I am here .
Corrected sentence : Firstly , and most importantly , what I want to say is that I have
Corrected sentence : I started learning English 2 years ago .
Corrected sentence : Privately , I 'm working as a firefighter ; it 's attractive but also very challenging .
Corrected sentence : A dangerous profession .
Corrected sentence : For me , English is really important , and I feel much better when .
Corrected sentence : I go somewhere , and I can talk with people from a different background .
It seems that the provided sentence is incomplete , as it only contains the word `` country . '' To assist you effectively , please provide a complete sentence that contains grammatical errors , and I will help you identify and correct them .
I often travel ; that 's why I can use English from time to time .
It seems that the sentence you provided is incomplete . Please provide a full sentence so I can help identify and correct any grammatical errors .
The corrected sentence is : `` One advantage of why I try to learn this language is that I need it .
Corrected sentence : In my work .

Corrected sentence : England visited my company , and they stayed in Poland for 2 weeks .
We went with them to some kind of social event where we
Corrected sentence : This could change our experience with them .
I felt really bad when I could n't cooperate with the team .
The original sentence `` England . '' is a fragment and lacks context . To provide a corrected version while maintaining clarity and accuracy , we can expand it into a complete sentence.Corrected sentence : `` England is a country in the United Kingdom .
Corrected sentence : That is why I 'm here ; my friend from Poland sent me your address .
Corrected sentence : Thank you for your help .
Corrected sentence : Best wishes , Patrick .
The advancement in technology has a major influence over transportation systems , and the new roadways are more convenient to travel .
As personal transportation provides more convenient options to people , the public transport system is losing its market .
The market for personal vehicles has become cheaper and safer than before , as a major hike has been seen in their growth .
Now , people being more professional are quite keen to save their valuable time by moving from scheduled public transport to personal cars . Luxury and speed have become status symbols for car owners , and it is also a better way to avoid public interaction and annoyance .
Corrected sentence : The new multitasking lifestyle better suits the preference for personal cars , allowing one to keep and carry all the things one needs .
Since Maggie 's class won the prize in the basketball game , their teacher took the students to a nature reserve to observe animals .
Maggie , along with her best friends , was so excited that they kept taking pictures with the animals .
Corrected sentence : Halfway through the tour , they went to the hippo area .
Fortunately , the hippo mother gave birth to a new baby last month .
The hippo baby was so cute that Maggie wanted to take a picture of it more closely .
However , little Maggie knew that her mother was nearby and assumed that she was attacking her baby .
The mother ran out of the river and chased after Maggie . Corrected sentence : The mother ran out of the river and chased after Maggie . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
As the teacher saw the scene , she called the reserve staff to save Maggie from the horrible hippo .
After a few minutes , several strong men came to shoot it with a tranquilizer dart .
It was such a fortunate thing that no one was injured .
Nevertheless , Maggie sincerely regretted being a troublemaker .
She has vowed that she will stay away from wild animals , no matter how gentle they might look .
During the 20th century , there have been several worldwide discoveries that have significantly influenced people 's lives .
I think that the most significant discovery or invention depends on the individual .
Every individual holds a different perspective on life and what they consider to be valuable and important .
I chose cultural awareness and understanding of prejudice and discrimination as my topic because I greatly value all of humanity , and I believe that all people should learn to live in peace .
Cultural and racial equality is a new term that we , as a society , are striving for .
People have come to realize that racism is almost inherent in today 's society . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No corrections are needed . )
As individuals , we are constantly surrounded by racist and discriminatory media language and advertising .
In the past , this type of discrimination , which includes not only African Americans but also other ethnicities and women , has been accepted as a way of life .
Corrected sentence : Few individuals have been courageous enough to challenge the deeply bred stereotypes and inequality , and to demand freedom and equality .
Numerous hidden talents , strong and wise personal voices , and the great knowledge and learning that result from human experience and suffering have been buried under the ignorance of our society .
Corrected sentence : However , today we are beginning to move in a new direction . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
People are understanding that prejudice and discrimination are not consciously learned ; rather , they must be unlearned .
Together , as a society and as a much larger world , we are recognizing the value in learning from differences .
Cultural differences are no longer being ignored or concealed ; rather , they are being celebrated .
Organizations and forums are currently being held to discover new ways of dealing with discrimination and racism .
The opportunity to learn about the vast world around us is opening up , and the availability to study cultural differences and reflect on that knowledge is improving .
Unlearning prejudice may not seem like a traditional discovery , but it is very significant to the development and peaceful existence of all humanity .
As human beings , we need each other , and we need to be willing to accept those who are different .
The advantage of being famous is mainly that you have more privileges than other people , such as entering places without waiting in line or even not paying your bill in some cases .
On the other hand , in my opinion , it has more bad things than good ones .
Everyone can recognize you , so they might bother you to ask for a signature .
Corrected sentence : So you ca n't move freely anywhere , and you have to hide to rest from the crowd .
Corrected sentence : That 's all , in my view .
Hello , I 'm Alisa , an Italian girl who is 27 years old . I would like to apply for this job opportunity as my dream is to go to the USA .
Moreover , this way seems to be perfect for realizing it .
I believe I would be a suitable person to join your staff , as I already have experience working with children . I enjoy working with them ; they are so genuine and imaginative . Essentially , you do n't work for them , but `` with '' them .
I adore children , and they usually love me .
I 'm a cheerful , willing , educated person .
I speak Italian as my mother tongue , and I have a good level of English and French .
I have been playing volleyball for 12 years , and I used to attend a theatre course . I also have a degree in fine arts , so I will be able to easily organize sports and creative activities .
Furthermore , I have a pastry degree , and I 'm not afraid to work in the kitchen ; cooking and baking are some of my favorite hobbies .
I hope my candidacy will be considered .
Corrected sentence : Best regards ,
It seems that the sentence provided is incomplete , as it only contains the name `` Alisa . '' Please provide a complete sentence that contains grammatical errors , and I will be happy to help you identify and correct them .
For as long as humans have been alive , they have invented things .
Corrected sentence : Important early discoveries included the wheel and the discovery of fire .
In the long line of such discoveries , modern man has continuously found new ways to make his life easier .
Corrected sentence : So , naturally , when man invented the washing machine , millions of lives were made simpler .
The washing machine , in those houses that own one , has almost become a necessity .
Should there be a fire in the house , many people might be seen furiously running about in the streets , clutching their machines tightly to their chests .
In today 's society , to be without a washing machine or any other electric gadget seems to be devastating .
Corrected sentence : Whatever would a college student do without a washing machine ?
Where would we find the time to hand-wash our clothes ?
The mere thought of washing clothes by hand causes panic in most teenagers , students , and adults .
This modern invention , the washing machine , has instilled a fear of hand washing clothes in the hearts of many .
Give an average adult a washboard and soap , tell them to do a load of laundry , and watch the panicked look on their face .
Thus , it is easy to see that while washing machines , microwaves , toaster ovens , and millions of other gadgets facilitate our modern lives , they also contribute to our tendency to rush around .
These `` wonders '' make it easier to spend less time on manual labor .
Corrected sentence : But is that all that bad ?
Many housewives insist on its benefits , and I have to agree .
But the washing machine is just another invention in a long line of inventions that make our lives easier , yet it does n't allow us to exercise or use our muscles .
It is no small wonder that in today 's `` modern '' society , as we continuously use our `` modern gadgets , '' we increasingly need diet programs and other such systems .
Yes , the old days were hard , but was Weight Watchers ever an issue ?
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , more and more parents are starting to teach their children at home instead of sending them to school . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
This may not be a bad idea at all , but it also has some disadvantages that I would like to discuss . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
Firstly , we should take into account the fact that parents are n't usually specialists in all fields of study ; even if they have a degree in History , they may not know how to help their children with a mathematics problem .
Besides , staying at home rather than going to school reduces the opportunities to meet new people and make friends .
This is n't a good thing for the children because , in that way , they are n't socializing , and when the moment comes for having an interview to get a job , they wo n't really know how to behave .
On the other hand , having the chance to learn at home helps some students who , due to their complicated situations—such as an illness— can not go to school like other children .
To sum up , I consider that children should study at school if they can afford it , because in the majority of cases , parents do n't have the same knowledge as teachers .
Boxing is one of the most popular sports of this era ; it is also one of the most deadly .
During a fight , a boxer may receive several hundred punches to the head , and each time he gets punched , he loses more and more brain cells .
The brain is encased in the skull , but not only is the brain in the skull ; there is also a liquid 'shock absorber ' to protect the brain .
Even though there is a protective liquid , the brain still gets bounced against the skull , damaging it more and more each time .
So , a boxer who has been boxing for a number of years—ten , for example—and retires is very likely to have brain damage , which could be very severe or hardly noticeable , but the damage is still there .
Corrected sentence : Shifting from the long-term effects to the short-term effects , yes , brain cells are still being killed ; however , when a boxer receives a very strong punch directly to the face , it not only damages his nose , eyes , teeth , and general facial features , but it could also cause him to enter a coma , hemorrhage , or die .
Another aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top-ranked boxers receive .
The question that people have is : is that person really worth several million pounds ? Corrected sentence : The question that people have is whether that person is really worth several million pounds .
Corrected sentence : Just for a fight against another top-ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds .
Another adaptation of cost is the expense of having so many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be elsewhere , where their presence is more important , and where people are n't getting paid to fight .
The major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport ; there is an incredibly high demand for it .
Boxing is one of the most popular sports , and banning it will be difficult .
Not only does it satisfy the viewers , but a lot of companies also sponsor boxing , which brings a lot of advertising and capital for them .
A study group is a gathering of people who come together to discuss topics they choose .
Corrected sentence : So , if you join a study group , you can understand what others ' ideas are and how they think about this problem .
Also , you can share your own ideas with others so that there will be a discussion about them .
Corrected sentence : Through this discussion , I think we can understand our thoughts and others ' opinions more clearly .
The corrected sentence is : `` Another benefit is that you can seize the opportunity to express yourself efficiently and methodically ; that is , your speaking skills will be improved .
Corrected sentence : However , why do some people still study by themselves ?
In my opinion , I need to consider one question deeply by myself .
Corrected sentence : Sometimes , too many other people 's thoughts disturb me !
Maybe I will become a person who only listens to others ' ideas and never thinks for myself if I depend on study groups too much .
To join study groups is a good way to inspire your learning motivation , but do n't forget that sometimes you have to be alone and consider what you have learned calmly .
My favourite sport is football ; the first time I saw it was nine years ago , and I liked it so much .
It was a game between Chelsea and Bolton , and Chelsea won 5-1 .
I got a lot of new feelings because I have never liked it and never watched it before .
I noticed that Lampard was a leader of that team , and he scored two times in that game .
Now , I have been supporting Chelsea for nine years , and I can assume that it was love at first sight .
My advice for people who play is to never give up playing and supporting the club that gave you a chance to play and be a part of that team .
Corrected sentence : Respect your coach even if he is very strict .
You have to put a lot of effort into this stuff if you want to reach your goals and aims .
You have to be ready to get through a lot of traumas , injuries , and problems that you will encounter on your road to success .
If you put in a lot of effort now and are strong enough to get through , you will be proud and achieve everything that you wanted to achieve .
Dear Thomas ,
Corrected sentence : Recently , you asked me about a place you were going to visit .
I think there is a perfect spot for you ! ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
In the heart of Katowice , there is an apartment with a specific aura of mystery .
This attic flat has been used as a painting studio by the famous Silesian painter and performer , Andrzej Urbanowicz , who died a year ago .
The place hides a fascinating story about the underground culture in Silesia .
For quite a long time ( especially in the 60s ) , the studio was frequented by lots of bohemian artists , where they could follow occult and Buddhist practices as well as paint some psychedelic pieces of art .
The apartment is located close to the famous Andy Warhol studio , which was rented back in the 60s in New York City .
Urbanowicz had created a fantastic place full of rather peculiar yet fascinating things and a Far East atmosphere—there are loads of figurines , paintings , old lamps , carpets , and dolls reminiscent of those from horror films such as `` Child 's Play .
Some time ago , I took the opportunity to experience this magical aura for myself .
Just for once , the apartment had been transformed into a temporary cinema for those who came to see the film by Nina Menkes , `` The Phantom Love , '' which fit perfectly with the surroundings .
I must say I ca n't imagine a better place to experience and appreciate Silesian art history , so I recommend it to you from the bottom of my heart .
The sentence `` Yours sincerely , '' is already grammatically correct as it is a standard closing in a letter . However , if you are looking for a complete sentence that includes a subject and verb , you might consider : Corrected sentence : `` I remain yours sincerely . '' If you meant to keep it as a closing , then no correction is needed .
It seems that the provided sentence `` Patrycja . '' is incomplete and lacks context . If you intended to provide a longer sentence or a specific context for correction , please share that . However , if `` Patrycja '' is meant to be a name or a standalone statement , it is already correct as it stands . If you have a different sentence in mind that needs correction , please provide it , and I 'll be happy to help !
Corrected sentence : The only thing that matters is to love what you do ; because of this , I have helped you prepare for your concert .
I can say that experience is demonstrated through practice and theory ; you have to like what you do . I helped with a lot of love because I admire the job .
I gathered a lot of experience from my expeditions through many countries , and I was a DJ at clubs . I felt so good when I saw that many people gathered at my concert .
I try my best to make people feel good and have fun with my music . What I can say is that I truly love what I do , which is why I helped you with ease .
I hope you will go and tie up your work , and then send me an email back with your successful experiences .
In my area , I collected all this experience , and I feel like a happy man .
Corrected sentence : Now that I have gotten away , I am a talented artist .
With respect , I welcome you , my friend , and again I say it was a pleasure to help you !
It is said that boxing should be banned ; described as a barbaric sport , it is known to lead to the deaths and brain damage of fighters .
The constant pounding of the head during a match does n't necessarily take its toll immediately , but as a boxer 's career continues , the chances of him having some kind of serious brain damage are fairly high .
Is it right that we watch with excitement as someone is repeatedly battered about the head until they are no longer able to stand ? Could this not have an effect on our general attitude towards violence , especially in children who are brought up to 'worship ' idols such as Frank Bruno as he pummels someone into a hazy blur ?
Corrected sentence : Should boxing be banned ?
My answer to all of these questions is `` no .
Maybe boxing is brutal , but fighting is part of human nature , and I feel there is no point in trying to stop people from fighting in controlled circumstances .
Who has the right to tell someone whether they are able to take a chance and face the risk of death ?
If boxing were banned , where would we draw the line—skiing ?
Corrected sentence : Is it mountaineering ?
Corrected sentence : Are you diving ?
Darts ? I feel it is a human right to be allowed to face the risk of death , and it is a matter of personal opinion whether you watch it or not . Boxing is usually on late at night , and children only watch it if their parents allow them to .
I think boxing should be encouraged in rundown inner-city areas such as Moss Side . Boxing is popular ; it gives young lads a focus in life and provides them with a target .
Many of the best boxers came from such areas ; in my opinion , they are better off boxing than stealing cars , taking drugs , and shooting each other .
Banning boxing is simply unnecessary ; if it were banned , it would continue to exist 'underground ' .
This would mean that boxing would become a much more dangerous sport , as expert medical attention and proper match control would n't be ensured ; the use of pads may also be ignored .
The only suitable action to be taken would be to increase safety regulations , i.e. , Corrected sentence : The only suitable action to be taken would be to increase safety regulations , i.e. , to ensure better protection for all .
Corrected sentence : Head guards and better gloves should be used in all fights , or the length of fights should be shortened to reduce some of the constant pounding .
Corrected sentence : Gaining entertainment is enjoyable !
Corrected sentence : Sports have been , throughout history , one of the many entertaining things to watch .
The international survey announced by Sports Watch caught my attention , and I would like to present my life on a plate .
Corrected sentence : First , most of us enjoy watching football .
Is there always someone who will not stop commenting on the new situation happening unbelievably in the match ?
Even though I am a girl , football is one of the main sports I watch on TV .
My eyes sparkle when I wait for a score to end the match or when a red card is given unfairly . Corrected sentence : My eyes sparkle when I wait for a score to end the match or when a red card is given unfairly . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
The second one would be skiing . Corrected sentence : The second option would be skiing .
I enjoy this sport and feel a sense of admiration for those who practice it .
For them to be prepared for many obstacles and to chase around the time and finish line is amazing .
You need to focus , have a lot of energy , and mostly have strength .
Not everyone is able to cope with that , which is something that should be recognized .
Are you thinking about the influence on the way sports have developed ?
In my opinion , tradition remains important even in the 21st century , and sports differ from country to country .
On the whole , it does seem that watching sports entertains people from all over the world .
When the banknotes are made , the background color , artwork , and security features should be designed carefully .
Corrected sentence : Then , skilled machinists manipulate the metal plate preparation .
What 's more , printing is a very important step for thinking about sheets , color , special ink , and so on .
While the most important step is inspection .
In this step , it would produce good quality sheets , bad sheets , and partially damaged sheets .
The good parts of the partially damaged sheets will be cut into separate banknotes , packed , and dispatched for packaging and distribution along with the good quality sheets .
Corrected sentence : While the bad sheets and bad parts will be destroyed , they will be disposed of properly .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have private lives without journalists following them all the time .
I definitely agree with this statement .
We are all humans .
Corrected sentence : That means everyone deserves privacy . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
Corrected sentence : It does not matter who we are , even in public life .
Film stars should sometimes be awarded for their patience in confronting journalists .
The spicy news about politicians and other celebrities , like film stars , is most wanted in today 's life .
The truth is that politicians should take responsibility for their decisions in government and take into consideration the words they say .
It also covers film stars because they are the last word for a young nation .
In my opinion , there should be some hard borders that paparazzi can not cross .
They should n't hound celebrities during their holidays , when they have family problems , or when they are dealing with personal issues .
Corrected sentence : Today 's people are fed with gossip regarding .
We live in the 21st century , so people who decide to be public figures should be aware of the photographers and pushy paparazzi who want to poke their noses into their intimacy by all means .
One of the most incredible discoveries of the 20th century , in my opinion , is the cellular telephone .
Many people buy them to take with them wherever they go so that they can receive calls at any time .
They are a complete luxury , not a necessity .
The cellular telephone has changed people 's lives in many ways , the main one being the ability to be reached at any time .
Communication is now readily available in cars and on the streets .
People are able to use their car phones in case of an emergency if they are stranded or broken down .
They can take their cellular phones on vacations and to their friends ' houses if they are expecting an important call .
To me , it is a bit ridiculous , but many people feel that they need easy access to a phone .
Another way the cellular telephone has affected people 's lives is the accident rate of people who are talking on their cell phones while driving .
When someone concentrates more on their telephone conversation and less on their driving , they are more likely to get into an accident .
This often happens when people are in heavy traffic and are not concentrating on the cars in front of them .
Corrected sentence : So , cellular phones also have negative aspects .
Cellular telephones are also very expensive . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
They are expensive to buy , install , and use .
Corrected sentence : Whether you are making a call from a cellular phone or receiving one , it costs a lot of money .
Although most people who can afford to buy a cellular phone can also afford to pay the bills !
The other day , I called my father in his office from Madrid . On his `` party line , '' he was able to connect my sister in Santa Barbara and my mother in Los Angeles on her car phone .
I find it truly amazing that it is possible to speak with four people at once , especially when one person is in Spain and another is in a car !
It is truly a mark of great technological expansion .
Each year , a new , amazing product astonishes me even more .
I am starting to wonder when we will have robots that clean our house and drive us around .
The scary thing is that it 's just around the corner !
My most memorable experience was a trip to Hue with my family .
When I entered the university , my parents decided to give me a wonderful trip .
I felt so amazing because my family and I had interesting memories together .
I had one week in an ancient city .
I visited many sights in Hue , such as the peaceful Perfume River , Trang Tien Bridge , Thien Mu Pagoda , and others .
Moreover , I gained a clear understanding of Vietnamese history by visiting the beautiful tombs of the Nguyen Kings .
Corrected sentence : I especially experienced making `` NonLa , '' a beautiful symbol of the Vietnamese people .
Corrected sentence : Hence , I learned about one of the traditional crafts in Vietnam .
Furthermore , I enjoyed many dishes with ethnic flavors .
Besides , I had dinner on an imperial boat and enjoyed Nha Nhac Cung Dinh Hue .
The original sentence is grammatically correct . However , if you are looking for a slight rephrasing for clarity , it could be : Corrected sentence : In 2005 , UNESCO recognized it as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity .
I prided myself on Vietnamese cultures .
This was an excellent experience for me .
Through it , I 'd broaden my knowledge about its cultures , religions , customs , and the like .
Corrected sentence : Special , it brought me beautiful emotions and memories of my family .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
I am writing with reference to your advertisement in the Jornal da Madeira on Wednesday , 14th February . I would appreciate it if you could send me a more detailed description of your English course .
Could you give me information about the schedule , the number of students in a group , and the tuition cost ?
Moreover , it is important to me that teachers are native speakers .
I am interested in joining the course , particularly Level B2 .
Corrected sentence : Do you have any vacancies in the group ? ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
Also , I would like to know whether you accept the results of my tests confirming my knowledge , or if I will have to take the test at your school .
The original sentence `` I am looking forward to hearing from you soon . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Corrected sentence : Yours faithfully ,
The sentence `` Nadya Razorenova '' does not contain any grammatical errors , as it appears to be a proper noun ( a name ) . Therefore , no correction is needed . Corrected sentence : Nadya Razorenova
The original sentence `` My favorite sport is tennis . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : My favorite sport is tennis .
In my free time , I like to watch plays from around the world on television .
When I was a child , I began to play tennis , but I broke my arm and could not continue .
I would like to know about the life of a famous tennis player .
I admire a tennis player ; he is a top sports person .
His name is Roger Federer , the best tennis player in the world for many years .
He was born in Suize 36 years ago .
When he plays in the finals , he always stays calm and has a positive attitude .
He has been the best player since he was young . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
He has been playing tennis for 26 years . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
He is the kind of person who always plays one-on-one .
He has built up a fortune of at least 100 million dollars , and he is the world 's highest-paid tennis player .
He has a beautiful family with four children : two twin boys and two twin girls .
He had a beneficial organization that helped the children .
Corrected sentence : His wife always follows him . I think that he is a great person and the best tennis player .
Corrected sentence : Network analyses in political and economic research : organizations and institutions .
Corrected sentence : Basic network concepts .
Corrected sentence : Practical applications .
Corrected sentence : Foresight of the development is important .
Corrected sentence : Software for interdisciplinary research is available .
Interdisciplinary network theory can be applied in a number of research studies due to its large empirical orientation .
Flexibility is achieved by an algorithm from graph theory that is adapted to many issues .
As a first example , we adapt the methodology and tools of network analysis to the concept of political networks in order to optimize the interaction among various international actors .
In the second case , we examine the results of network analyses of the university 's partnerships .
Corrected sentence : The university identifies the key areas of its activities for his contribution to the development of the territory .
Over the past few years , our monarchy has gone from one scandal to the next and from one disaster to another .
The British public has been made to realize that the Royal Family runs just like any normal family , only with a lot more money .
Many people are now questioning the value of even retaining the monarchy .
Not so long ago , people thought that our royals were carefree and lived ideal lives .
That way of thinking began to change after the disastrous marriage that brought Sarah Ferguson into the family .
No sooner was she married to Prince Andrew than things started to go wrong .
Public scandal surrounded their relationship , and their breakup represented the start of a downhill run for the monarchy .
Yet again , only recently , with the announcement that Prince Charles and his wife , Princess Diana , have been given permission by the Queen to divorce , we have been shown that no family is perfect .
Their separation , of course , followed Charles 's affair with Camilla Parker Bowles .
So people say that we should not have a monarchy where they all cheat on one another , and many certainly think that Prince Charles has no right to become king .
Many people argue that we can not afford a monarchy , even though the Queen does now pay taxes .
This was highlighted by the fire at Windsor Castle , for which the taxpayer had to foot the bill .
I personally feel that we should retain the monarchy .
They are our country 's heritage , and other countries envy us for our monarchy .
They give our country something to feel proud of ; who has never dreamed of being royal ?
Corrected sentence : About Me
Hi , I 'm Adal Reuterswärd , and I 'm 13 years old—14 in January .
I have two sisters : Siri , who is 11 years old , and Lotte , who is 2 years old ; she 's very annoying .
All of us were born here in Danderyd , but we moved away when I was 4 , and we have lived here since then .
Before that , I think we lived in Sollentuna or something ; I 'm not sure .
I love skiing , which I do 2 to 3 times a week , and sometimes 4 .
Corrected sentence : But only in the winter , of course . I also dance on Mondays , practice at home , and play the guitar .
Otherwise , I love to paint , and I watch a lot of TV shows , like Pretty Little Liars , The Vampire Diaries , Glee , and more .
All of them are American , so I 'm kind of used to it ; that 's why I like to speak .
My favorite show is The Vampire Diaries ; it 's the most exciting . However , the next episode comes out , I think , on October third , so I have to wait until then .
I have visited Paris a couple of times , and I really like it .
My grandparents live there , but they are n't from France ; they just moved there .
I do n't know why ; it 's a nice place , I guess .
They moved there with my dad and his other daughter , my aunt , when he was about 14 .
My favorite book , I think , has to be all the Harry Potter books . I read them a couple of years ago , and after I read the first book , we watched the first movie , and then we did the same thing with the second book , and so on .
I 'm thinking of reading the books and watching the movies again because I barely remember anything .
But I remember thinking they were so exciting , and after I read the last book , I thought I would never find a good book again .
Corrected sentence : I did , but none were quite as good as Harry Potter .
I like to listen to a group called Skyscraper , which consists of four boys from different places in Sweden , and I also like Lucy Hale , an actress from Pretty Little Liars who has released her first album .
My favorite song of hers is called `` Road Between .
I also like Ariana Grande , and I 'm listening to her new album a lot .
At first , transportation is a very important means of our daily life . We will talk about the various modes of transportation .
In the past , the only means of transport were riding horses , camels , and donkeys , and there were no mechanical means . However , riding animals was a safer means of transport than the means of today , as there are no vehicle exhausts that pollute our public atmosphere , and the dung of these animals is useful as fertilizer for farmland .
Transport evolved gradually until it reached bikes and carts , and then cars with engines .
Today , all people use engine-powered vehicles like motorcycles , cars , trains , and planes .
Corrected sentence : As well as being much faster than the last means , this means also pollutes our atmosphere .
Corrected sentence : As vehicle exhausts hurt our hearts , affect our breath , widen the ozone hole , cause a lot of noise , and create traffic jams .
Corrected sentence : But people do n't concern themselves with these dangers ; they are only concerned with their luxuries and comfort . I think that no new means will be invented .
Corrected sentence : People are satisfied with engines , such as those in cars .
One of the most significant inventions of the 20th century relates to the speed at which information is now communicated throughout the globe .
In fact , all improvements in communication have had a profound effect on the way people live their lives .
If I were to choose the most frequently used and influential invention in the field , it would have to be the television .
Through the television , news and information can be displayed graphically at the very same time that they are happening .
This simple fact has changed in many ways how we live , and in a way , it has continued to shrink the planet we live on .
There are , however , several downsides to television , and like all inventions , it can be used in a useless way .
Not even truly addressing the amount of television that is watched by the average person , there are several other important ways that television has changed people 's lives .
One interesting development has been the use of television during wars .
The Vietnam War was the first time that U.S. citizens were able to really see what it was like to be at war .
This was one of the factors that led to much of the protests .
We are also able to see for ourselves what is happening around the globe , and this has led to public concern and efforts , for instance , in Somalia .
Of course , radio was already able to transmit sound , but the arrival of the picture has had even more significance .
The greatest effect that television has had is that it has made the dimensions of the planet smaller .
Gone are the days of unknown and unheard-of areas .
Television can bring any part of the world into your living room within seconds .
It is also a very influential and powerful device because it is the easiest way to communicate with populations .
There are many who feel that it can be a harmful thing , and this is true . Corrected sentence : Many people feel that it can be harmful , and this is true .
It is also used in ways that can desensitize one 's sense of what is actually being portrayed because the images themselves are not real .
Either way , however it is used , there is no doubt that it has been one of the most significant inventions of the 20th century .
The truth is that we are all different .
I ca n't speak for others , but in my experience , I would say it is a good idea to take a year off after high school .
First of all , because most of us probably do n't know what to do with our lives , we often just do what other people tell us to do , especially our parents .
Corrected sentence : Second , because it is healthy to travel , one can get to know new cultures and new traditions .
But you can do other things , like working , saving money for college , or starting a new business .
Corrected sentence : If you have worked before , you will have more experience than others , which gives you an advantage .
You will become more independent and more aware of life in general .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
He had to escape as quickly as he could .
The police alarm could be heard in all the streets .
So , he knew that the police were near .
Michael threw the knife he had in his hand into the bush in front of the house .
He ran faster than he ever had before .
Suddenly , he heard some dogs barking .
At that moment , he started feeling really nervous .
He hid under a big car and waited there .
He was afraid and worried about what had happened . Corrected sentence : He was afraid and worried about what had happened . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are necessary . )
He did n't want to kill his ex-girlfriend .
Corrected sentence : However , Michael had no choice .
Anne had broken up with him over something stupid and irrelevant .
Corrected sentence : She deserved it .
After a few minutes , he saw someone going into the car where he was hiding .
If he escapes , the person will see him .
Before he could do anything , the car started , and it was too late to leave .
Television is a subtle magic box that enlightens our lives .
From the screen , audiences can raise their awareness of events happening around the globe .
Or they can find a spectrum of emotions that they might not experience in their daily lives by watching different movies .
Corrected sentence : Truly , television symbolizes a dramatic advance over today 's entertainment .
Nevertheless , it can also be billed as a means of education .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , when people mention education , an idea comes to mind in which we sit in front of books with teachers or computers nearby .
Most books are inches in thickness .
Corrected sentence : And each side of that is filled with black-and-white images followed by a colorless description on the side .
Only by our minds can we imagine objects or ideas described in them .
Televisions , on the other hand , offer a much more colorful learning experience through a screen .
Items have been categorized according to their attributes .
Theories and models try to consolidate with each other to explain one of the variances in the world .
For television , however , objects can be expressed in a real-life manner .
Audiences are able , through observation , to understand the variety of their surroundings from time to time , as well as the correlations between different matters .
They are given the complete picture and process of our environment , not just a photo .
The lack of natural light in the workplace became a serious problem as more people complained about their bad relationships with others at work and their poor performance ; therefore , inadequate lighting is the main reason for this .
First of all , not using natural light in the workplace can deteriorate , albeit in a small but significant way , the health of employees ; this is because neon lights can affect the eyes and may also lead to headaches if used for long periods of time .
As a result of suffering from headaches , the workers have a greater chance of feeling nervous and anxious , and their performance at work might decrease .
Secondly , as a consequence of being in a bad mood , there is the possibility of a lack of cooperation and an inability to concentrate on what needs to be done , which also affects productivity and overall development in the workplace .
In conclusion , there are many reasons that support the need for employees to have access to natural light while doing their jobs , as the lack of it can have negative effects on both people and productivity . Therefore , this issue should be taken into consideration , and a solution should be found to address it .
Hello , Jo .
I 'm glad to hear from you .

Fame is an asset for every celebrity . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
Broadly speaking , being famous means being well-known , and a great deal of effort is used to achieve that popularity in order to be recognized instantly on a TV screen .
It may seem that the image of a person lives a separate life from the person who created it , but that is not actually true .
There are several reasons why the image overlaps with its creator .
One reason is that usually the same actor represents the same character in a succession of films , allowing the actor to blend with his or her character .
Also , sometimes a reversal of the situation occurs when an actor becomes memorable for a particularly successful role in a film or play and is associated with that one role only .
In short , actors become associated with their roles , and it is not easy for them to change their well-known image even in everyday life .
Corrected sentence : Regarding other socially-oriented celebrities , other issues arise .
For politicians , keeping a high profile is essential because they are known in conjunction with their actions .
As for journalists , it is essential for them to appear in their programs to become recognizable .
Overall , these celebrities use their visual images as a brand for what they do .
To sum up , attention from the public towards a celebrity is a good sign for him or her , as it means that this person is truly famous .
Regardless of their will , they would be pestered by some journalists , and their lives would also be in the limelight because that is what people want to know—this is how being a celebrity works .

I am writing to inquire about your summer camps in the USA .
I would be grateful if you could send me further information about it .
In addition , I have a few inquiries .
Firstly , do you take school leaves ? I have recently finished school , and I would like to be an assistant teacher in an educational program in a developing country .

I finished my training last year .

Today , most people think that after-school sports clubs are necessary .
Corrected sentence : However connected are the advantages and disadvantages with it .
Corrected sentence : I presented it in my essay .
I ask my young friends for their opinion on after-school sports , and some tell me that it is good , while others say that it is not .
In the first place , I must say that when young people participate in sports , they are certainly healthier , more athletic , and , of course , fitter . So , if you want to be fit , you should take up a sport .
Corrected sentence : The disadvantages of participating in sports include , for example , the fact that if you have an injury , you ca n't be active , and your weight may increase significantly .
Corrected sentence : Secondly , when you are exercising or playing , you experience an adrenaline rush , which makes you feel excited and self-confident , and it definitely affects your relationships with other people .
Unfortunately , you have a shortage of time to study because you spend time at the gym or on the pitch .
Another important aspect is that you will be the person who ensures a good team spirit , but also , when you are in a team , you can sometimes argue .
All in all , I still think that after-school sports clubs are a good idea .
In my class , most students say that sports are great .
Corrected sentence : Healthy and young person
Young people are less healthy now than they were twenty years ago , according to studies that have appeared recently in newspapers .
One reason for this is that young people prefer to play video games rather than play outdoors because it is more popular , or , for example , because they are not used to playing football with their parents in the street .
Besides , young people eat too much junk food , and they 're less willing to participate in sports that require more effort .
If I were a politician , I 'd encourage people to exercise outdoors , and I 'd build a sports center where you would n't have to pay .
In my opinion , junk food should be more expensive so that people would n't buy so much .
When you start exercising , you soon feel better and ca n't stop .
Corrected sentence : Kaplan is outside the area .
It seems that the sentence provided is simply the word `` Introduction , '' which does not contain any grammatical errors or context to correct . If you have a specific sentence that contains grammatical errors , please provide it , and I would be happy to help you correct it !
The purpose of this report is to discuss how Kaplan College should spend a large amount of money to improve its outside area .
Corrected sentence : Build a garden .
Every Kaplan student knows that behind the Kaplan building is a useless area where the College can spend money to build a nice and beautiful garden .
This place does not have anything useful for everyone , so it would be awesome to invest in a garden that all the students could use to relax in their free time .
Corrected sentence : Food and drinks
The college needs to invest in some nice and healthy restaurants surrounding Kaplan because many students have been complaining about the food and drinks they have to buy at school or in the surrounding area .
I heard a student say that around Kaplan there are just junk food restaurants .
They should spend time at some nice , healthy , and inexpensive restaurants in the outdoor area of Kaplan .
It seems that the sentence you provided is incomplete . `` Recommendation '' is just a single word and does not contain any grammatical errors or context to correct . If you could provide a complete sentence or more context , I would be happy to help identify and correct any grammatical errors .

These would have a beneficial effect on all students . Corrected sentence : These will have a beneficial effect on all students .
Personally , I think people 's lives will change regardless of what we do .
Corrected sentence : There is nothing we can do about it .
Corrected sentence : But what we can do is decide whether that change will be for the best or not .
Corrected sentence : It sounds very easy and simple , but it is not .
We do n't make changes ; changes are the result of the decisions we make and the consequences of our actions .
One of the biggest changes that we can see nowadays is how blind we humans are to everything that surrounds us .
We go through our daily lives lost in our minds , thinking about expenses and personal issues , that we do n't take notice of what surrounds us .
We do n't notice other people ; we do n't communicate with each other .
Corrected sentence : We are lost in our minds , in our cellphones , and in our earphones .
Corrected sentence : And this is a consequence of the poor use that we have made and continue to make of technology , which will lead to another significant change fifty years from now .
Corrected sentence : It ’ s like a vicious cycle .
Fifty years from now , people wo n't know how to talk to each other .
We will lose our social abilities .

People interviewed at the front door of the main public building , such as Town Hall and schools , have stated that they feel , on average , happy about how the council has dealt with problems arising from the new aspects of the town , particularly regarding the following subjects :
Air , light , and noise pollution : about 80 % of citizens declared that they feel very satisfied with these issues because cars are not allowed to transit in the city center ; public lights are powered by solar panels , and moreover , the mayor has signed an agreement with the builders ' union that obliges them to create public parks in every area with 1,000 residents .
Recycling : all families are provided with three litter bins in which they must recycle rubbish , and at school , children have been concerned about the subject since primary school .

Treviso can offer a high standard of quality of life , and people are aware that achieving this goal is something to work towards together .
A historical place in Sweden , I would say , is the royal castle .
Corrected sentence : It 's in Stockholm , the capital of Sweden .
It 's big , beautiful , and contains a lot of history .
The royal castle was rebuilt in 1697 after the fire .
It was n't in use until 1754 , and it was n't finished until 1770 .
Since then , not much has been rebuilt .
On the inside , there have been some changes and modernizations to fit the royal family , and some paintings on the façade on the outside .
Some museums have been added , and the royal castle is now a very popular tourist attraction .
I have personally never been there , but it would be interesting to go sometime .
An invention of the 20th century that I feel has significantly changed people 's lives is the introduction of bank cash machines , or automatic teller machines .
I can not comprehend how difficult it would be without this convenient access to money in emergencies or situations when money is needed .
It is also a convenience that helps to save time , which is very important to working men and women of the late 1900s .
This machinery also permits you to do your banking whenever you wish , rather than during the assigned banking hours .
People may argue that ATM machines will take away employment in banks , but we must also focus on the positive aspects .
ATM machines appear in all areas of the world .
In the United States , for example , you can find machines in stores , movie theaters , parking lots at shopping malls , and at banks .
In many situations , I have either forgotten my wallet or have not had enough money at the grocery store .
This is when I really appreciate having my ATM card .
Another advantage of the card is the reduction of the danger of having large quantities of cash in your home or wallet .
This entices robbers and can promote danger . Corrected sentence : This entices robbers and can pose a danger .
All in all , I feel ATM cards are an excellent invention . The convenience they provide has proven itself in many circumstances , and I do not know what I would do without my card . The development of computerized technology has enhanced our environment by providing convenience and time-saving activities , which reduce the stress of our everyday lives .
The Amazon lava lizards are pretty hard to see .
When you saw one , it probably already saw you .
I noticed in the field that the big males are more conspicuous than the juveniles , immature males , and females .
The adult males always seemed to be in the same place .
However , I ca n't confirm that they were the same males in the same places .
The smaller individuals had a tendency to run away quickly when they noticed someone coming .
Corrected sentence : Also , they commonly go back to the same place just after fleeing .
The lizards can stand still for a long time with few movements , usually of their heads .
The big ones showed more communicative displays , like head bobs and push-ups .
The boardwalk was the only point where I saw more than one animal that could interact with each other .
In other places , when there is more than one animal , they are away from one another and do n't interact .
The animals that use the boardwalk were more exposed than the animals at the other points .
The animals that I observed among the vegetation were usually sheltered either by dense shrub or bush vegetation , or on a bromeliad leaf that had spikes on the edge .
The distance to cause flight in these animals was larger than that of the boardwalk lizards .
I feel like I should tell her the truth and beg for her forgiveness , '' Mark said to Michael .
Their friend Jenny was going to be out of town for a few days , and she asked Mark to take care of her cat while she was away .
He agreed to it , but he did n't really pay too much attention to whether the doors of his house were properly shut , so the animal escaped .
Jules is nowhere to be found , '' he sighed .
I 'm just going to buy her a huge bouquet of flowers and hope she does n't take it too hard .
Corrected sentence : Michael , however , thought that his friend was overreacting .
I 'll fix this for him since he 's too stupid to fix it himself , '' he thought .
He went into the first pet shop he found and bought a Siamese cat that he thought looked identical to the one entrusted to Mark .
Dear Jenny , I 'm sorry that I 'm having Jules delivered to you , but I 'm busy and ca n't drop him off myself .
Corrected sentence : `` Love , Mark , '' he wrote on the card accompanying the cat cage .
The next day , there was a loud thumping at the door .
Corrected sentence : It was Mark , and he was furious . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct , so no changes are needed . )
Did you really think that Jenny would n't notice that it is n't her cat ? Corrected sentence : Did you really think that Jenny would n't notice that it was n't her cat ?
Corrected sentence : How dare you use my name on that card ?
Corrected sentence : Now , she does n't want to talk to me ever again .
Corrected sentence : `` And neither do I want to talk to you again ! '' he shouted as he quickly made his way off the porch .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
A film I want to recommend for our student club is Captain America : The Winter Soldier ; it has a lot of adrenaline and emotion .
This film was launched on the 13th of March , and it was a big success .
Using the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) is popular in the modern world , although it does not work well in areas where the GPS signal is interfered with .
Consequently , indoor navigation with GPS is not very effective .
This paper aims to propose an alternative method to GPS for use in indoor environments .
The methods developed in this paper use only the position of the Wireless Access Points ( WAPs ) and the signal strength ( RSSI ) recorded by the user in order to calculate the position of the device .
Since today 's computers and cellphones contain all the required hardware , a future adoption of these methods would not only be easy but also cost-effective .
One of the methods proposed in this paper usually gives the user a position that is about five meters off .
Therefore , this method can not be used when a more precise estimation is needed .
However , a weighted average of these three methods , together with different similar methods , might enhance the accuracy .
At the beginning , it is worth thinking about what the phenomenon of shopping is .
Some people claim that doing shopping delivers them a lot of pleasure .
Recently , I met an example of a woman who maintained that spending money helps her calm down .
Corrected sentence : Yes .
In my family , there are five people : my dad , my mum , my older sister , and my younger brother .
Corrected sentence : All of them who always talk , share , and support me in everything .
They are not only my family members but also my best friends .
When I was a child , my dad or mum usually took me to school by motorbike ; I have beautiful memories of that time .
They bought me all the nice things that are useful for studying and made me interested in studying .
When I got a bad score , they did not blame me ; instead , they always said , `` We count on you . '' Thus , I never felt scared or worried whenever I did something wrong , and that made me very confident .
I often told them my story before I went to sleep , like how I made friends with a boy in class , how I got over a dog on the road , etc .
Corrected sentence : But after growing up , I was not as close to my parents ; I had many outdoor activities with my siblings , such as exercising and traveling .
In that time , we overcame all problems and gained a better understanding of each other .
So now I am overseas , and I always think about my family as my best friends ever .
Corrected sentence : Hi , dear Hanna .
Last summer , I worked at the cinema , and it was a very good experience for me . I enjoyed it so much because I met a lot of people from different countries and cultures . I worked there for about three months , and the pay was satisfactory . At the cinema , I learned a lot of film names that I had n't heard before . My colleagues were very kind and friendly , and after we finished our jobs , we remained good friends and spent time together going out for drinks and sometimes for dinner .
I hope to do the same job next year because I love it and want to do it again .
In the future , public transport will no longer be required as `` owning your own vehicle '' becomes very common .
The justifications behind this are :
The advanced technology reduces the costs of manufacturing and maintaining automobiles to a very affordable level .
Please provide the sentence you would like me to correct .
Recognizing transportation as a necessity in daily life , the government will provide subsidies to residents who can not afford to own a car .
Under the future social welfare scheme , a person who earns an annual income below a specific threshold will be provided with a car at no charge ; in addition , all related maintenance costs , such as gasoline , parking , insurance , and tuning , will be reimbursed by the government .
There is no need to get a driving license to operate a car .
With the assistance of advanced global positioning system technology , we can simply voice input the place we would like to go , and the car will automatically take you there with ease .
Corrected sentence : When will the day of `` no public transport '' come ?
We can not tell at this moment , but one thing is for sure : technology keeps changing our lives and ways of living .
The airport in my city is not very far from my home , but at the same time , it is not easy to reach .
The more comfortable way is to have a private car with which it is possible to take the highway and then head in the direction of the city center .
My home is close to the central rail station and the most important bus stops in the metropolitan area .
As a second option , there is a railway service from the airport to a secondary rail station .
Here you have to get off and then take bus number 25 , which will take you to the center of the city , from where I can reach my home on foot .
Another possible option is to use a taxi service ; however , in this case , the cost of the journey is the most expensive of all .
The two best choices to return home from the airport are to use a private car or to use the railway airport service , which is very affordable . I spend a bit more time and money , but the journey is nice and comfortable , similar to the trip with a private car .
I am a tall , blonde girl who loves all sports , but my favorite is basketball .
I enjoy this sport because it is very dynamic , teaches me many things such as being polite and very responsible , and above all , it is a group game , and I love working as a team .
I would like to give one piece of advice to someone who wants to start practicing this sport : always work as a team and not only think of yourself , but also consider what is best for the team .
The doorbell rang .
When I opened the door , I was surprised to see that my brother 's foot was covered in blood .
The original sentence `` I was really upset . '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , a corrected version would remain the same : Corrected sentence : I was really upset .
He came in , and I helped him . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
I told him that he must go to the hospital to take care of his foot , but he did n't listen .
He was afraid that if he went to the hospital , his parents would find out about this .
I asked him how it happened , and he told me that he fell off his motorcycle .
Corrected sentence : That 's when I realized what was going on .
He did n't want our parents to know because his godfather had just bought him the motorcycle , and our mother was against it . However , he did keep it on one condition : that he would be really careful .
I told him that we had to go to the hospital , even if that meant our parents were going to take his motorcycle away .
He understood that he had no choice , so he agreed . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
I called my mum and told her everything that had happened .
She came over to our house and took my brother to the hospital .
I was really worried , but hopefully everything is alright .
The pie chart depicts different proportions of fuel types that generated energy in Florida in 2007 compared with the forecast for 2017 .
Overall , it is clear that natural gas is the main energy generator for both years , while renewables and oil come at the bottom of the list .
For example , the energy generated by natural gas increased from 38.8 % in 2007 to 54.4 % in 2017 .
Next comes the energy production from coal , which accounted for 29.3 % of the energy market in 2007 , followed by a drop of 5.6 % in the forecasted year of 2017 .
Corrected sentence : As for nuclear energy , although it represents the third largest energy generator in Florida for both compared years , the trend here is upward , reaching 15.9 % during the estimated period .
In contrast , there is a significant drop in energy production from both oil and other sources in the two separate years , with a decrease from 6.7 % to 1.1 % for oil and from 11.1 % to 3.4 % for other sources .
As for renewables , the decrease in fuel generation over the period is less dramatic .
There are some reasons to explain how Venus shines so brightly according to the text .
In addition to these reasons , the passage contains information about Venus 's temperature , and the listening passage can refute some information that is expressed in the text .
Some questions are asked during the listening to expand the information about this planet .
How can Venus be so hot if it is covered by thick white clouds ? It should be cold , should n't it ?
There is another doubt about this high temperature : there is a planet closer to the sun that is hotter than Venus , so it is n't hot because of your location nearby .
The most amazing question is : How can it be hot in a place where sulfuric acid prevents the sun from coming inside ?
The listening passage could link the information in the text , stimulate some questions , and also provide answers to make the reader more curious about the topic .
There are many problems facing both road and rail transport in the UK . ( Corrected sentence : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . )
The most talked-about issues concerning roads are probably congestion and safety .
Congestion is most apparent around the major conurbations such as London , Greater Manchester , and Birmingham .
The simple way to solve this problem would be to either build more roads or to make the present ones larger .
However , this , as seen in recent events , for example , Newbury , has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents .
Another way to reduce congestion , especially in large cities , could be to persuade people not to use their vehicles at all .
Introducing schemes such as the 'park-and-ride ' scheme and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number of cars on the road .
Safety is often discussed as a priority factor regarding roads .
Corrected sentence : Too many accidents occur due to dangerous driving on busy roads .
The original sentence `` There are several ways to combat this problem . '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : There are several ways to combat this problem .
Although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased , lowering the limit by several units would deter many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use public transport .
Increasing the amount of law enforcement could also be effective , giving the police more rights to make arrests and increasing the number of speed cameras , as well as possibly giving larger fines .
Cutting down on the national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care .
The condition of roads is often a local issue rather than a national concern .
It is therefore up to the local council to maintain its roads better , especially in winter .
This may require the local council to obtain more money from the government .
Safety is a much lesser factor for rail transport .
Corrected sentence : Here , the major talking point is efficiency .
It is often noted that trains are delayed and rarely run on time .
Corrected sentence : Because of this inefficiency , many of Rail 's customers are turning to other forms of transport—mostly cars—but for long-distance journeys , flying is an increasingly attractive option .
A large amount of blame for this inefficiency goes to the actual trains , which are in most cases out of date and slower than modern ones , such as the French TGV or the Japanese 'bullet ' train .
The train tracks can also be blamed , as they are often in a state of repair , which inevitably delays trains .
It is hoped that the recent privatization of British Rail will bring in more up-to-date trains and increase the overall efficiency of traveling by train in a bid to attract many more customers .
The author in the reading part thought technology allows us to live more comfortably .
The author provided an example : first , we do n't have to eat raw meat nowadays because someone discovered how to use fire ; second , we do n't have to live in caves anymore .
However , the professor disagrees with the author .
Corrected sentence : She thinks that technology does not always help us ; on the contrary , it makes things worse .
She said technology brings us weak relationships with family and friends .
Corrected sentence : And then it even makes our circumstances worse because it causes a lot of pollution .
Finally , the professor suggests that we should reduce our use of technology .
If we reduce our use of it , we will have a good relationship and a better environment .
Apparently , the author did n't notice the bad influence of technology .
In this essay , I will put forward and briefly break down the controversy that involves problems related to zoos .
Corrected sentence : As a controversial topic , there are arguments both for and against it .
Corrected sentence : Depending on the point of view that each person might take , the argument they give will vary .
It is very likely that animals in zoos suffer from not being in their natural habitat , being stared at almost all the time , not having the space they require to live comfortably , and lacking the natural peace they need to thrive .
Furthermore , it is not only important to say that its animals live in groups , but also that in contrast , their numbers in zoos are limited to just a few .
Corrected sentence : Nevertheless , it is very useful for society , especially for children , to have the opportunity to go and experience a visit to a zoo .
If it were not for the zoos , it would be practically impossible for the majority of the population to know about wild animals .
It provides a wide range of possibilities not only for children but also for adults , such as veterinarians , scientists , and , why not , anthropologists too .
All in all , it would be difficult to find a fair solution or to provide a solution that addresses both sides of the issue in question .
In my personal opinion , I reckoned that safari parks would be a solution in the middle of these opposing sides ; they would provide a better quality of life for animals and would also be an educational way .
Corrected sentence : Firstly , what is the European Union ?
It seems to have two distinct forms , of which one seems to worry the British public the most : Political Union , followed by Economic and Monetary Union .
In fact , these issues have become so heated in Great Britain at present that they have led to many disputes within the current government .
They also appear to be one of the major reasons for Mrs. Thatcher 's resignation .
In losing her , have we not already lost part of our sovereignty ?
Europe is forcing change upon us as we have been attempting to stand back , `` not letting socialism in by the back door , '' instead of playing an important role in positively affecting the decision-making processes within the European Community .
Great Britain can not afford to play a minor role in a two-speed Europe , especially in times of recession , and this has manifested itself in top governmental disputes .
Corrected sentence : A loss of sovereignty seems inevitable , whether we like it or not .
On monetary and economic union , I do n't feel that we have much to lose ; in fact , on the contrary , I think that we would benefit enormously , especially in light of 1992 .
If only the issue were presented in a more positive light , perhaps with some modifications , I am sure that the British public would give their agreement . Corrected sentence : If only the issue were presented in a more positive light , perhaps with some modifications , I am sure that the British public would agree .
After all , how long has it been since we lost our sovereignty to the follies of the international stock exchanges of New York , Tokyo , and Frankfurt ?
Corrected sentence : Will losing our sovereignty to Brussels or the Bundesbank make a significant difference ?
Did not the `` Big Bang '' in October 1987 send shock waves worldwide , with share prices plummeting ?
World processes are continuously becoming more and more interlinked ; the effects of which often see no physical borders .
I therefore see this European unity as a natural process in world development , something that should be made easier rather than hindered .
Can we really afford to play for time by dragging our feet ? ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
The issue of political union is still more disputed .
Yes , we have a Queen , and what would happen to her ? Would she be forced to abdicate and be succeeded by King Jacques Delors ?
This is a very typical , misinformed , and ignorant statement posed by certain British `` patriots .
There are five other monarchs in the European Community , and their statuses will not be significantly affected by any such union .
But there is a true cause for concern about Brussels ' bureaucracy , which rightly worries the British public .
This situation must be changed to rid the Council of its secrecy and to transfer greater power to the European Parliament for a more democratic system . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are necessary . )
This will mean that everyone will have a fair say in what goes on—something that must be guaranteed for such independent thinkers as the Britons themselves .
An answer to Britain 's reservation on European unity , which I find most plausible at present , is a federal union that would ensure decisions are taken at local levels whenever possible .
This , if properly carried out , would enable us to keep our cultural identity—the ultimate element of our sovereignty .
Dementia is a type of common disease among the elderly population .
Corrected sentence : And it is difficult to be cured by humans , so robotics are used to help them .
Corrected sentence : For this case , at this moment , research reported that :
Corrected sentence : Socially committed robots are designed to promote therapeutic interactions .
Corrected sentence : Communication and social interaction .
The therapeutic use of the robots is intended to .
Corrected sentence : Reach out to people affected by dementia and provide an alternative mode of support .
Corrected sentence : Engagement with this population is important .
The sentence provided appears to be a citation rather than a complete sentence . However , if we assume you want to format it correctly for clarity and accuracy , it should be presented as follows : Corrected sentence : ( Mordoch et al. , 2013 , p. 15 ) The correction involves adding a period after `` al '' to properly format the abbreviation `` et al .
Corrected sentence : Consequently , these robotics offer benefits to patients by facilitating personal interactions , enabling them to feel pleasure and relaxation .
Corrected sentence : In Japan , there is a keen interest in using robots to care for the aging population . The reason for this is that home care facilities and hospitals can not allow animal-assisted therapy to enter .
Unlike Japan , in North America , people prefer to use animal-assisted therapy , but the use of robotics is less than that of animals .
I 've been a member of the Active Leisure Club since 7th April 2013 , and I 'm really pleased with your letter because it means that you care about your customers .
What I really appreciate is the staff 's qualifications , particularly in the fitness courses and their punctuality .
This aspect is really important for working individuals .
I have to congratulate you on the cleanliness of the environment : everything is always perfect , and I often see showers being sanitized , and people do have respect for every common space .
Corrected sentence : I also have some suggestions . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
It would be really useful to have some hairdryers in the locker rooms ; this way , people could enjoy a complete service and arrive home relaxed or ready to go out .
Another service that could make you competitive with other centers would be having a massage room ; after any sports , it would be nice to have a personal masseur who takes care of your tired body !
Corrected sentence : Anyway , I 'm really glad to have a leisure club in my city that helps me keep fit !
Corrected sentence : Thank you for your interest . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
Corrected sentence : To whom it may concern ,
The sentence `` MARY JAMES '' does not contain any grammatical errors , as it appears to be a name . However , if you intended to provide a full sentence or context for correction , please provide that , and I would be happy to assist !
Mary , James , and I have met at Marianista School .
We have gone to secondary school together , and we have been friends for five years , so we know each other very well .
When Mary was in secondary school , she proved herself to be a brilliant student .
She was not only competent , but also hard-working , and that was reflected in her high grades .
Nevertheless , she was not boastful ; instead , she would help other students who had difficulties with the subjects .
She was appreciated by both students and teachers for her kindness and willingness to help .
The original sentence `` Mary is extremely loyal to her friends . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : Mary is extremely loyal to her friends .
She is also caring and supportive , and she knows exactly what to say when you are going through a tough situation .
Moreover , she is a very enthusiastic and energetic person , and whenever she sets an objective , she accomplishes it .
When Mary was a student , she was very self-demanding and wished to do everything perfectly ; as a result , she was sometimes overwhelmed .
However , as the years went by , she managed to handle those situations as she learned how to organize and complete her tasks in a more efficient way .
Mary was always interested in British culture ; therefore , she has studied English for several years and read many books about Great Britain .
As she has finished high school , her intention is to pursue a career , and she is looking for opportunities that will enable her to achieve her goals as well as develop her English-speaking skills .
It is clear that the post you are seeking to fill would undoubtedly suit her , and I have no hesitation in supporting her application .
Corrected sentence : Yours faithfully ,
It seems that `` Jeni Jackson '' is just a name and does not contain any grammatical errors . If you intended to provide a longer sentence or context for correction , please share that , and I would be happy to help !
Would you like to find out the best place for our last dinner ? Corrected sentence : Would you like to find out where the best place for our last dinner is ?
Firstly , we must look for a restaurant that specializes in groups , because we are a large number of people .
If we go to a normal restaurant , we will dislike the treatment .
I am sure there are some restaurants where we can go .
I am going to explain what my favorite is for this special occasion .
I suggest `` Pomodoro .
This is an Italian restaurant that is located in the city center .
Both characteristics are the most important to me .
First of all , most people like this kind of food , such as pizza or macaroni .
Corrected sentence : Also , the location is perfect because we can easily arrive by walking or by bus .
After dinner , we may go to some discos or pubs .
Corrected sentence : Besides , this restaurant has delightful decor .
It seems you are sitting in a Roman theatre .
The waiters are from Italy , so they may talk with us in Italian , which would be very useful for practicing this language .
In conclusion , I recommend this restaurant .
Corrected sentence : It is the ideal place for us : a big space , delicious food , and a great location , of course .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , film stars , musicians , politicians , and models live in the limelight .
Some of them want it , while others are less enthusiastic about being in the center of attention .
Corrected sentence : Journalists often follow them .
In my opinion , celebrities have a right to a private life , but that is only as long as they do n't reveal everything about themselves in the tabloids .
Corrected sentence : First of all , everyone has the right to privacy .
Being a famous artist or politician is an unusual job , but it is still just a job , and after work , everyone wants to have their own life .
From the other hand , being a superstar , it 's almost impossible to have a private life . Corrected sentence : On the other hand , being a superstar makes it almost impossible to have a private life .
Corrected sentence : Well-known people are frequently in touch with their fans , and most of the public know them very well .
In my view , everyone has a right to privacy with no exceptions .
Corrected sentence : Journalists who follow the celebrities just cross the line .
The paparazzi often exceed the limits of privacy .
We do n't have to know everything about them , such as the hair condition of some actress when she was shopping .
Superstars also deserve to have their own lives ; no one deserves to be followed or spied on .
Colombia 's army is a good comparison to other armies in Latin America and to other armies in the world .
Even so , many Colombians do not know that the hard work of their soldiers , day by day , must be done for the sole purpose of protecting our lives and guaranteeing democracy for all of us .
Therefore , it is necessary to know why the Colombian army has this distinction .
First , the military forces of Colombia have 438,700 active personnel , making it the largest army in Latin America , followed by Brazil .
On the other hand , the Colombian army is regarded as one of the best armies in the world due to its internal conflict , which keeps the soldiers in action and in constant training . Additionally , Colombia is training other Latin American armies , as well as those from Africa and the Middle East , because of the anti-terrorist war that the Colombian armed forces have been engaged in for 40 years . This has strengthened them in a masterly manner through their preparation , intelligence , and modern tactical aids .
Second , it is necessary to highlight some of the work performed by our army in the anti-terrorism struggle , such as foiling terrorist attacks , neutralizing explosive devices left in urban and rural areas , preventing the recruitment of children , providing medical brigades to help farmers , and , most importantly , offering their lives if necessary to protect each and every one of us , even without knowing us .
Finally , I could say that the hard work and the good image that the Colombian army has just reflect our wish to live in peace .
Likewise , all the Colombian people want to reach their dreams in a peaceful way , without weapons or fights between brothers , and thus show the world that they are brave enough to fight for peace .
Dear Paul ,
Corrected sentence : What 's up ?
Corrected sentence : Sorry , I did n't answer your letter earlier .
I was really busy because of organizing the next concert .
By the way , your VIP tickets are waiting in the drawer of my desk .
As you asked me , I 'll write you something about helping with Kokon 's concert , which took place last month .
It was a huge challenge for me because I was responsible for almost everything . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
Corrected sentence : At the beginning , I had a problem with the owner of the pub .
He was n't convinced that we would be able to sell as many tickets to pay for the pub .
He did n't know the band and was really skeptical about it .
Corrected sentence : But you know , where there 's a will , there 's a way , and at last , I won him over .
When he came to the pub an hour before the concert to see how things were working , he was just speechless with surprise .
His pub was fuller of people than ever before .
I did n't tell him that even though Kokon is quite an underground band , it has so many fans !
His facial expression almost killed me when I saw it .
It was a mix of outrage because of the crowd in his pub and happiness because of the money they spent on beer .
Corrected sentence : And how about the concert ?
Corrected sentence : It was incredible .
Although I had to take care of everything , I could have a great time too .
We are planning the next events with the leader of Kokon .
I 'll let you know about the concerts coming up this month .
Just tell me when you are going to come back to Bytom . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct , so no changes are necessary . )
Corrected sentence : Kisses .
It seems that `` Wydra '' is not a complete sentence and does not contain any grammatical errors to correct . If you meant to provide a different sentence or if `` Wydra '' is part of a larger context , please provide more information so I can assist you better !
She started her life with so many problems , and after every sad period , she discovers that she has enough capability to continue .
But the most difficult thing about her perspective when she is exposed to losing someone is that , although she has lost many people in varying circumstances , she is still not used to the feeling of loss , and she feels pain each time , just like the first time .
She experiences traveling , and she attempts to leave behind everything that causes her sadness . She tries to keep away from politics and removes the images of the military and weapons from her mind , but the blood of humans has haunted her .
She was writing about each important event .
I think that nowadays most people use public transport very little .
I understand that the car is more comfortable and safe for travel and for making short trips ; however , this is more dangerous for the environment .
People in some countries use different forms of transport , such as bikes or trains , to move around the city .
Scientists around the world are investigating genetic manipulation for a wide variety of beneficial purposes .
Genetic engineering is , however , a very controversial issue , and there is a lot of resistance to this work , especially regarding the suggestions of using it on humans .
The trouble is that although a scientist may think he knows a lot about a particular area of study—and indeed he may—there is still so much that we do not know about areas of study like genetics that there is a great fear of the unexpected .
Corrected sentence : Indeed , this fear is justified .
When we consider the horrific effects of a nuclear holocaust , I am sure there are many who wish it had never been discovered .
But are we right to blame the scientists who first started the research and had no idea it would be used as a weapon ?
We can argue that the scientist must surely have the greatest realization of the uses of the discovery , whether good or bad , since he is the expert on the subject .
Corrected sentence : But are we right to blame him ? ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
Let us consider that he has discovered a cure for cancer as a result of genetic engineering . Corrected sentence : Let us consider that he has discovered a cure for cancer through genetic engineering .
It is against human nature to stop at this stage and ask , `` Should I introduce what could be the greatest medical discovery of our lifetime when I am not 100 % sure of the consequences ?
Corrected sentence : Can we expect a scientist to bear this additional burden for the whole world ?
In truth , no , it is unreasonable .
Genetic engineering is developing rapidly and has already been used extensively in plants and bacteria , notably for the production of resistant strains of plants and for the production of human insulin .
The natural step forward now is to apply this knowledge to treat common genetic disorders , such as Down syndrome .
There is a lot of resistance to this , along with fears that we may manufacture mutants or that someone may produce an army of superhuman clones .
Some of these may seem a little far-fetched , but it is conceivable that in 100 years ' time , we may be able to decide the characteristics of our child , whether he is a great piano player or a sportsman .
It does not seem morally right to make these decisions , and certainly , to anyone religious , it would be seen as interfering in the ways of God , which is something to be avoided at all costs .
A great scientist can not see the future .
He can not gauge the moral repercussions of his discovery , nor the long-term effect it is going to have on the world .
If he is doing research for what he considers to be a good cause , who are we to criticize him when we know far less about it ?
Corrected sentence : Provided a scientist 's work has been permitted and is public , I feel it is unjust to hold him responsible for what the world will make of his work .
To avoid continually writing `` he/she '' and `` his/her , '' the scientist in this essay has been referred to as `` he .
I hope no offense is taken from this .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
I am writing in response to the invitation to share my experience in making a hard decision that appeared in the July issue of your English-language magazine .
As a nineteen-year-old student , I have gained familiarity with this topic by deciding which course of study I was going to choose .
First of all , I strongly believe that making choices is always risky because people do not know what the exact result will be .
Like most adolescents , I was at a total loss when the time came to decide what I wanted to be in the future .
In despair , I applied for two courses of study , which did not resemble each other at all , making the moment of choosing a lot harder .
Knowing that not only was this choice a fundamental decision , but it was also one that would influence the rest of my adulthood , I appealed for help in deciding what I should focus on at the moment of making my decision .
As time passed , I had to attend more and more classes .
I could not cope with such a busy timetable , and consequently , I was exhausted and stressed .
A decision had to be made before I dropped out of both courses of study .
I kept in mind the pieces of advice I was given and chose what made me happy , despite not having the approval of some of my relatives .
I am convinced that stark choices are unavoidable , but in order to avoid regretting the consequences they might have , either positive or negative , people should choose what makes them happier .
However , I have not taken for granted that my decision will not make me regret .
If this were the case , I know that I am always on time to start again .
For the aforementioned reasons , I think choices must be carefully considered before they are made .
Corrected sentence : Even though this does not assure the results .
I look forward to following subsequent articles on related topics .
Corrected sentence : Yours faithfully ,
It seems that `` Vilma Rossit '' is not a complete sentence and does not contain any grammatical errors as it appears to be a name . If you intended to provide a different sentence for correction , please share it , and I would be happy to help !
There are many standards by which success and hard work have been measured and rewarded in the past . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
In earlier times , people had a lifestyle of fending for themselves .
They were not afforded the many luxuries that have become commonplace in our current society .
Because of the differences in personalities and ambition , I feel it is vital that in today 's society , men and women should be financially rewarded for their individual efforts .
In a society , each person has the same basic needs for survival .
Long ago , the quest for the fulfillment of these needs took up the majority of each person 's day .
In order to feed your family , you had to plant .
Corrected sentence : In order to live , you have to build .
To have clothing , you have to sew .
Each hour of each day is devoted to meeting these needs .
Even in early times , the harder you worked , the more food , shelter , or clothing you gained .
This is a very simple principle of reward equaling effort .
Bringing this to a more present time , we are now reaping the benefits of advanced technology , expanded knowledge , and modern advancements .
We have many machines to help us meet our food , clothing , and shelter needs with little or no effort on our part , it would appear .
Persons with great technical minds are using their talents on the job and paying someone to do their work .
Corrected sentence : However , just as in earlier days , the harder you work , the greater the rewards .
Let 's imagine a society where all men and women are treated equally .
All basic survival needs ( and even wants , for that matter ) were provided regardless of the effort put forth . I would venture to guess that we would not be as advanced a society as we are today .
Corrected sentence : Competitiveness and jealousy would set in , and fights would occur .
Corrected sentence : In the worst-case scenario , the world could become divided or even destroyed because someone is sitting on the sidelines and not doing their share .
We would not have the motivation to develop our talents and abilities and to use them in a way that benefits others .
Our society would become selfish and hoarding , and our culture would suffer .
It may be a pessimistic view , but I feel it is a very real perspective to say that we would become lazy and stagnant people .
Life is about rewards . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
Corrected sentence : It is about learning where you are and how you can move to the next level .
Each of us is measured daily by some scale of achievements .
Effort is vital to success ; motivation is the key to effort .
Some are content with their needs ; others want more—much more !
Our system of rewards is money , but is it really about money ?
The original sentence `` I do n't think so . '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , no correction is needed . Corrected sentence : I do n't think so .
It 's about meeting needs ( and even wants ! ) and how much one is willing to give for the opportunity to achieve something better .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
My name is Ciprina Pires , and I am 17 years old .
I 'm writing to you because I have seen the advertisement for a job at a summer camp in the USA , and I would like to submit my application for the position .
I like to work with children between 8 and 12 years old because they have energy for everyone and might understand some of the activities that we will give to them .
Corrected sentence : Normally , I like to organize activities for others , and they might be interesting and different .
I love organizing evening activities more than the others because they are more exciting and more enjoyable .
Now , I have been cooking for my family , and I love it . I would also love to cook for 100 people .
I can speak English well enough that everyone can understand me . I 'm energetic , hardworking , and cheerful .
Sure ! Please provide the sentence you would like me to correct .
The sentence `` Yours sincerely , '' is already grammatically correct as it is a standard closing for a letter . There are no errors to correct . Corrected sentence : Yours sincerely ,
It seems that the sentence you provided , `` Ciprina , '' is incomplete and does not contain any grammatical errors to correct . If you meant to provide a longer sentence or a specific context , please share that , and I would be happy to help you identify and correct any grammatical errors .
The impact on modern biology was enormous , and for this reason , in 1993 , the inventor was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry .
For this invention , Mullis received a bonus of $ 10,000 from the company he was working for , but in a short time , the rights to use the process made the company $ 300 million !
The television is , for many people , the main way to spend their free time . Corrected sentence : For many people , television is the main way to spend their free time .
Children stay for more than one hour watching television in a day .
Parents are worried about what their children watch because they think that their sons do not learn anything ; it only entertains .
Corrected sentence : It is far from reality .
If we choose the correct programs , they could inadvertently teach us a lot .
There are a lot of documentaries about the environment , animals , and the human body that are very interesting and entertaining .
Corrected sentence : Cartoons can be dubbed into English or other languages to improve their accessibility .
The TV can be used to clear the mind or fill the brain with a lot of useful knowledge .
Corrected sentence : Now the stone is on its roof .
The original sentence `` Plastic bags are banned in the city . '' is already grammatically correct . There are no errors to correct . Corrected sentence : Plastic bags are banned in the city .
Corrected sentence : The town council is planting more trees .
Corrected sentence : A solar heater has been introduced in the houses instead of a water heater .
Corrected sentence : Rainwater storage system to increase water levels .
Human waste is properly handled by the town council .
Corrected sentence : The government is encouraging people to use public transport instead of cars .
Using a bicycle is a more environmentally friendly vehicle .
Corrected sentence : LED lights were introduced to reduce electricity usage .
Corrected sentence : Change is always beneficial .
It is widely accepted that change is an essential driver of progress .
In fact , for many people , without changes , mankind would still live as it did in prehistory , without fire , wheels , or even comfortable houses . We would live in caves , would n't we ?
We would only eat what our men would hunt .
We would wear animal leather . Corrected sentence : We would wear leather made from animals .
Corrected sentence : Oh !
Corrected sentence : What a ridiculous drawing it is !
Corrected sentence : But , in my opinion , the problem is more complex .
Conservative people , for instance , are usually reluctant to change because they are generally afraid of it , likely because they prefer familiar but undesirable situations .
In addition , if you take a glance at history , although times of revolution are usually traumatic , humanity tends to improve after them .
The question is whether convulsions , violence , and wars that often change need to be done at all .
It is often said that public transport is bound to disappear since most people seem pleased to use their own cars for nearly every journey they take .
This is probably true for the majority of people .
Sure enough , if asked , most people would say they prefer traveling by car to using public transport . Traveling by car offers many advantages .
Corrected sentence : For instance , you can decide exactly what time you want to leave and the place you want to leave from .
You do not have to share your journey with anybody if you do not want to , and you can reach the exact point where you want to be .
Everything about cars seems to have an advantage .
Corrected sentence : So , why does public transport still exist ? ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Corrected sentence : To begin with , not everybody can own a car .
But even if everybody could , it would be a nightmare to try to get to a big city , such as Barcelona , by car .
I do not think there will be enough space for so many vehicles , not only to park but also to circulate on the road .
Moreover , the level of pollution would be so high that I doubt anyone could survive it .
The future . Corrected sentence : The future is uncertain . ( Note : Since the original sentence is incomplete , I provided a complete thought for clarity . If you have a specific context or additional text , please provide it for a more tailored correction . )
The problems of this plant are increasing every day , and people ask themselves , `` What will the future be like in 30 years ?
We think that the world will be destroyed . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
At first , many kinds of plant species will have become extinct , and 90 % of fauna will be endangered .
After that , food will have become insufficient to satisfy society 's demands , and people will be dying of starvation . Diseases will be more common , and many people will have died due to epidemics .
An appreciable part of society will have been diagnosed with cancer . Corrected sentence : A significant portion of society will have been diagnosed with cancer .
Living in an egalitarian society , people will collaborate to save the world . We will use robots to clean the planet , scientists will design special clothes to avoid radiation , and people will use oxygen tanks .
Corrected sentence : Living in our current society , which is divided by social status .
Corrected sentence : Poor people will be living in trash , and rich people will be living inside spacecraft .
Corrected sentence : There will be wars over access to water .
Once you become famous , you will definitely know the taste and the price of fame .
There are many people in my country who keep thinking that being a famous person , to some extent , is a blessing .
Corrected sentence : Such a person is known by most people at the national or even international level .
Some believe that there are many advantages to being a celebrity or widely known person , though there are a number of disadvantages as well .
First of all , many local and world-known celebrities claim to have no private life .
Being famous means that probably most of your life , journalists , your neighbors , and ordinary people will be interested in you .
Most of the time , it is impossible to avoid this kind of attention . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
People are curious and admire their favorite stars ' lives by reading magazines , watching TV , or surfing the Internet .
Moreover , such yellow press columns with the title 'celebrities ' hit selling records , giving huge benefits to the publishing companies .
Millions of people are able to buy magazines with celebrities on the covers , although some photos provide readers with 'additional ' and not the most pleasant details .
People are interested in almost everything : articles about break-ups , drug-abusing young celebrities , questionable relationships , or even special ones featuring naked celebrity photos .
This is more than just sharing some details of your private life ; most members of the press look for scandals , and their aim is to uncover the most intimate secrets .
Secondly , being successful and famous also requires a person to be good at their job .
The 'star ' is followed not only by the public eye , but he or she is also evaluated by producers and future employing companies .
There is no doubt that celebrities work hard to achieve fame , better and more desirable jobs , including higher salaries .
The majority of celebrities have their personal managers , who take care of their image .
So even if you are rich and famous , it does not always mean that you would be able to live and act as you would like to .
Fame has another side : there are strict requirements for actors , singers , and others , which become apparent when they sign contracts with the companies that provide their jobs .
Attending some events or parties may be a necessity and does not always depend on the wishes of a celebrity .
Also , it is said that fame spoils people and they struggle with their personal problems ; however , it is even more difficult to help them than to help ordinary people .
Sometimes there are cases when the lack of private life leads to more serious issues .
We all know that some well-known people become engaged in illegal activities , start using drugs or alcohol , and join mysterious religious groups .
Sometimes , they even become suicidal simply because they can not live under the constant pressure .
Even if being in the public eye is not always very pleasant , there are a number of advantages to why it is worth sacrificing a little of your private life .
Going deep into the public entertainment world , which is definitely rewarding , gives you a lot of benefits .
Most celebrities do not work all their lives , although the money they gain during their careers ( which can sometimes be a very short period of success ) allows them to live without any worries .
Giving away some personal life details while you are famous may bring you fortune .
For example , many celebrities sell photos of their newborn babies to magazines , as they offer enormous sums of money in order to provide a tiny glimpse into their family life .
Moreover , being a famous person means that you are able to influence other people , especially young generations . Corrected sentence : Moreover , being a famous person means that you are able to influence others , especially younger generations .
By setting a good example , celebrities may become idols and inspire other people to live and help those who are in need .
By donating money to charities and being involved in volunteering projects , you can do one of the things when you are wealthy and famous .
To summarize , fame comes with many disadvantages , as well as a number of advantages .
Corrected sentence : Celebrities have various experiences .
Their lives seem glamorous , and they look gorgeous , though you will never know what is beneath the 'beautiful and sparkling cover . '
Corrected sentence : Shopping online .
Currently , with the internet having penetrated our lives , shopping online enjoys great popularity among us , especially among young people .
Although some deny the appeal of shopping online due to the virtual nature of the internet , I am unhesitatingly hooked on it .
First of all , we enjoy more convenience and time savings by shopping online .
Corrected sentence : For example , time and space can not be taken into account when we shop online .
Since we want to purchase something , we can shop online . Corrected sentence : Since we want to purchase something , we can shop online . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . )
As is well-known , there is no shutdown at online stores .
In addition , walking for a long time and distance could be avoided if we shop online . Corrected sentence : In addition , walking for a long time and over long distances could be avoided if we shop online .
Corrected sentence : Once we place an order , the merchant will immediately dispatch the goods .
Corrected sentence : Meanwhile , it 's easier to buy quality and inexpensive goods through the internet .
Thanks to the displays of customer feedback and the merchants ' reputation on the webpage , we can evaluate the goods directly and select the items we are eager for from the vast range available online .
Corrected sentence : Finally , shopping online plays an essential role in our lives due to its convenience and flexibility .
In other words , shopping online really perfects our lives .
I believe that it will be more wholesome and guaranteed with the optimization of the network market .
Dear USA Summer Camp ,
I want to have this job because I like children and being outside . I am also a person who works a lot , even if it is necessary at night .
I am very good at organizing activities suitable for children . Last year , I went to a campsite that taught me how to prepare activities for children and how to work with them .
Last year , I attended cooking lessons where I learned how to prepare food suitable for children . I also learned how to prepare desserts for both adults and children .
I 'm a nice person who is funny and sociable with children .
At the moment , public transport is used , but many people are starting to travel much more using their own cars instead of traveling with public transport , which , in my opinion , is better to use .
One reason for my opinion is that on a bus , train , or railway , we can fit more people than in a car or on a motorbike , so we pollute less because we use the same vehicle instead of each person using a separate car or motorbike , which pollutes much more . As always , things have a price , but there is a question that must be asked : is it worth paying to save our ecosystem or even our lives ?
I think so , and besides , it is much cheaper than buying a car and having to pay for petrol each month . Another reason I prefer to use public transport is that I have to adapt to a schedule , which helps me avoid being late to my destination . Additionally , bus stops have codes that indicate how long it will be until the next bus arrives .
To conclude , public transport is much better than using a car or a motorbike , but people can not see it .
Terrorism is the use of fear and acts of violence in order to intimidate societies or governments .
Many different types of social or political organizations may use terrorism to try to achieve their goals .
It is difficult to define what terrorism is .
Terrorism does not have an official criminal law definition at the international level .
Common definitions of terrorism refer to violent acts that are intended to create fear ( terror ) , are done for a religious , political , or ideological goal , and target civilians .
Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and warfare .
The use of similar tactics by criminal gangs is not usually called terrorism , though the same actions may be considered terrorism when carried out by a politically motivated group .
Best friends are meant to last forever .
In that sense , family will be there for us forever .
Corrected sentence : But what if they are not that close to you ?
What if they keep you pampered always ?
Of course , you will feel irritated , especially during your teenage years .
Family protects us and gives care , but it can be irritating if they do the same when you grow up .
Corrected sentence : They should give some space for themselves .
When you are a child , you love to be with your parents and enjoy hanging out with them . Once you grow up , your childhood changes , and you shift your focus to friends , considering them as your everything . However , keep in mind that only family will be there for you in the worst times .
I think they have changed since there are more and more overweight kids every day .
Portugal is one of the European countries with the highest number of overweight children , with a slightly higher percentage of overweight children than Spain and Ireland .
Eastern European countries are the ones with fewer fat kids , possibly due to the influence of former communist rule .
When you do n't have anything to eat , you do n't gain weight and , consequently , you do n't become susceptible to diseases that are common in overweight individuals , like diabetes .
That 's the only upside of communism over capitalism , although it is unintended .
Although it would be amusing for me to continue slagging off communism , let 's not go there .
The topic is about eating habits , which are always eradicated , along with health and prosperity , when communists gain power over countries .
Corrected sentence : Bang !
Nowadays , in my country , people eat a lot of the same unhealthy food that others eat in the rest of the Western countries .
We used to eat a lot of codfish , the stereotypical Portuguese food , and we still do , but now we also eat a lot of fast food , which is part of the reason we have so many overweight kids .
When I was a kid , fifteen years ago , the kids were slim .
When I entered the first grade , there was n't a single overweight child in the class .
Corrected sentence : Today , 32 % of children are overweight .
In the time period of just twenty years , we became one of the countries in Europe with the most overweight children .
So yes , eating habits have changed dramatically in my country , but we may get back our good old slim silhouettes after our new government—a coalition of socialists and communists—takes office .
Food : everybody loves it , but some people also hate it—those who ca n't control themselves and suffer the consequences of overeating on their health .
Lack of self-control is a very sad thing .
Corrected sentence : Fortunately , I do not have that problem .
I 'm lacking inspiration to write , but I will try because I have to .
Corrected sentence : The eating habits in my country .
I already talked about the overweight kids who eat food that makes them gain weight .
Shitty food is trendy in my country , as I mentioned , but that 's also true for every European country , as I previously stated .
But I guess it is better than eating roots and animal corpses , like our hominid ancestors ate millions of years ago .
Hunter-gatherers thousands of years ago ate roots too , but they did n't have to eat rotting flesh because they hunted animals—like the first half of their name suggests . I know I really look like an idiot for writing this kind of thing , but that only proves that I was telling the truth when I said I 'm lacking inspiration .
I 've been reading Milton 's Paradise Lost , first because I wanted to read it for its literary significance , second because I want to improve my English , and reading it is a good way to achieve that goal .
I 'm only in the first book .
It 's an excellent work , of course .
I thought I would have trouble comprehending Milton 's English because , you know , it 's not the English you hear from the average contemporary English speaker , but it turns out it 's a much easier read than I thought .
I find Shakespeare harder ; however , with a bit of effort , I manage to understand it too , but not always , at least for now .
Dear 230-year-old me , I am only 15 now , and I have n't lived enough .
I am just a kid ; I am not complete yet . I have a lot to discover and shape in my life .
I have no idea how I am going to get there . I am now in my bed studying for my tests tomorrow , but I guess in 215 years from now , it wo n't matter .
I really wonder how it feels to live that long ; are n't you bored of living ?
Do you ever wish you were dead ? ( Note : The original sentence is grammatically correct . No corrections are needed . )
I bet you have a God complex ; you must feel powerful .
Corrected sentence : But do you ?
Or perhaps you feel weak , vulnerable , dead inside , and lost ... You have lived for longer than anyone should .
Of course , living like this must have consequences . What is it like in your head ?
Corrected sentence : How do you feel ?
Corrected sentence : What do you think about yourself ?
Corrected sentence : Are you happy with what you have become ?
Corrected sentence : What have you done ?
What is the price of being yourself ?
Did you really give up everything to have what you have ? Corrected sentence : Did you really give up everything to have what you now have ?
The original sentence `` Do you ever regret it ? '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : Do you ever regret it ?
The original sentence `` Do you feel lonely ? '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : Do you feel lonely ?
What are you doing with your cold heart ? ( Note : The original sentence is grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Corrected sentence : Is there anything capable of unfreezing it ?
I dreamt of you , you know ?
We were in a forest ; the sun was at the top of the sky , the birds were singing , and I could hear the sound of the water falling . It was a heavenly place ; it was beautiful . Then you were there , behind a tree . You did n't say a word ; we just got closer . You were looking into my eyes , and so was I . Then I put my right hand on your cheek , and in that moment , I felt you—your skin , your soul , your existence .
Corrected sentence : And it lasted for a few moments ; it was magical .
I guess we are going to meet only in one place , in Heaven ; we are not supposed to know each other on Earth .
Not in our miserable mortal lives ; it does not matter anyway .
I felt you in that dream , and I would not change it for anything .
I feel close to you .
Corrected sentence : And somehow , without even meeting you , I fell in love with your existence .
And it kills me tonight that I will always have love in my heart for you , forever .
I will weep for you , my love , day and night ; even when my eyes wo n't let my tears slip away , my heart will always do so .
Corrected sentence : Reckless , pretty , and wild .
Corrected sentence : I hated the teacher , who was Clara .
She taught history in 2º E.S.O . She has short , curly brown hair .
She has always had a ponytail .
Clara was serious and bossy . ( Note : The original sentence is grammatically correct . No corrections are needed . )
Corrected sentence : She generally shouted at everyone when she taught a lesson .
Clara was worse than Pilar , my English teacher .
Pilar was kind and fantastic with children . Corrected sentence : Pilar was kind and fantastic with children . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
The corrected sentence is : `` The school 'Valle del Ambroz ' is a small place .
Corrected sentence : It has a small building located in the center of the village .
Corrected sentence : Classes are small and the pavilion is too .
The quality of teachers was good , although they explained very poorly because the students were not told very well .
I sometimes hated them because they did n't see the effort that we put in to pass the exams , as we were so psyched for them .
The other reason why it was difficult was that they put exams , and they were also demanding .
Corrected sentence : However , I have a great memory of all my teachers because they help me pull it off .
I ’ m still dreaming that there will be a chance for me to make a trip around the world . There are many ways to travel from one place to another , but I prefer doing so on a boat or a train . This is because on a boat or train , I can feel the wind on my face or my hands , and I can hear the sound of birds above me . On a plane , you can see only the blue sky and nothing more . It is a strange idea for me to be between the earth and the sky , so I prefer traveling by boat or train .
Not only does public transport have a future , but it also deserves a bright one .
Despite the fact that traveling by car may be more comfortable , we should all be absolutely conscious that public transport ought to occupy a prime spot in our future mobility .
Corrected sentence : Otherwise , the future of the Earth might be in danger .
Indeed , if we , as a civilized society , were aware of the problem of greenhouse gases that are repeatedly expelled into the atmosphere , we would use public transport much more often .
In this way , air pollution would be reduced as a consequence of using buses , trains , or the underground—all of which are public means of transport that can reduce the massive presence of private cars on our streets and roads .
Apart from cutting down on polluting gases in the atmosphere , the safety of our roads would improve because there would be fewer cars circulating throughout the country .
Both effects would combine to offer a healthier environment in which our children could grow up safely .
On top of that , there is no excuse to use public transport , as it has been remarkably improved over the last few years .
Nowadays , it is almost possible to access any place at any time by public transport , thereby erasing one of the main problems that public transport used to have for its potential users .
So , if we are determined to preserve our beloved planet and make it a better place to live , a good start would be to leave the car in the garage and take the bus .
The last film I saw was not new ; in fact , it was `` The Others . '' It is the best horror and suspense film that I have ever seen in my life .
It is set on a small English island and takes place in 1946 , after the Second World War ended .
Corrected sentence : A crazy woman is waiting for her husband .
She has the total obligation to protect her children because they are allergic to light .
Recently , three new servants appeared in the mansion : Bertha Mills , Mr. Tuttle , and Lydia .
Corrected sentence : Strange things happen in the mansion . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
At first , the little girl ( daughter of Grace ) , Anne , hears and sees these strange things , but her mother and Nicholas ( brother ) do n't believe her .
Anne always told her mother about the strange things that she sees , and Nicholas started to as well .
The time passes and everyone in the house starts to feel these strange things .
At this moment , Charles ( the husband and father ) returns to the house , but one day he will disappear another time .
One day , all the curtains in the house disappeared , and this was serious because the children were sick and could n't receive sunlight .
I would recommend this film to anyone because the story seems real .
The movie has excellent sound effects and transmits epic sensations .
As we discussed before the project was launched , the two-domain structure causes some problems and inconveniences in both management and maintenance , as well as in collecting analytics ( Google , etc . ) .
Thus , using a single-domain structure seems better if it is possible to develop the site in such a way ( in combination with WordPress CMS and custom code ) .
Now it 's time to draw the line on all the considerations and make the final decision ( with SCHEME included ) .
To ensure the relationship between members of the same species , the movements of the procession are specific to each , and the female selects the one that is the best fit .
Both mates performed movements to show submissive behavior and achieve copulation .
Before I start this pretty obvious presentation , I would like to share my own opinion : well-organized , good scheduling , and widely routed transport are one possible way to move around the city .
Corrected sentence : So , the advantages of a personal car are that you can be sure of who is in the vehicle , and you have control over your route .
Avoid wasting time on several stops , and you can reach your goal ( workplace , shop , or even suburban ski club ) much more easily and quickly .
The corrected sentence is : `` The above arguments are against having your own car—it 's expensive , not ecological , and you have to take care of your car ( parking , repairs , insurance , cleaning ) and find a lot of money to own a car .
Corrected sentence : Thus , the flexibility of the price is the main question .
As soon as the problem of the price of owning a car is solved , the question of the necessity of public transport will be raised again .
Many people believe that the future of public transport will not exist due to an incredible increase in the sales of new means of transport , such as electric cars and bicycles .
For this reason , people wonder if normal means of transport could disappear due to this new transport trend .
In my opinion , I am completely sure that public transport is the best option for getting around the city for several reasons .
First of all , taking into account the financial crisis , public transport , such as buses or the underground , is the cheapest way to travel or even move around in your own city .
Corrected sentence : Overall , if you add not only the petrol price but also the maintenance , services , insurance , and a few expensive taxes .
In addition , everybody knows that there are more people in a bus than in a car ; consequently , the pollution produced is less .
By contrast , it is true that many places do not have good communication and it could take you quite a long time to get there .
But imagine if everyone had a car ; nobody could arrive on time to work .
On balance , public transport is the best option for getting around the city .
Corrected sentence : But maybe , if communication between villages and bus timetables improves , public transport could be even better .
Since we had a lot of success with this invention , I started to have some fantasies about other high-tech portable inventions I could create .
I started imagining a type of synthetic textile or fiber that does n't get wet when water touches its surface .
This could be really useful for the military because sometimes they have to work in the rain , and their hands and bodies get wet , which is uncomfortable .
To do this , I had to alter the gravity of the water when it touches the surface , so instead of the material absorbing the water , it could reflect it .
At first , when I applied the chemical to the material , it became very rigid ; therefore , it was uncomfortable to use and had very little mobility .
I used a fraction less of that chemical to put it in the clothes to see the results of this minor change in volume on the secret substance I was using to make water reflect a cloth for military and various other purposes , such as using it on a rainy day to replace umbrellas , which could make a difference .
If this invention were able to work , I could foresee a lot of success and money coming to me . I suspended the cloth again to put the substance on it to see if this time it would work well . I could foresee that if my partners found out about my invention , two things could happen : they would be proud of me for starting to create and develop some new innovative ideas that could make significant progress for humanity , or they could get really mad at me because I did n't tell them about my project . Since we are working on an ongoing project that is very successful , they could be very disappointed in me for trying to create something new while we are still developing the invention we created about six months ago with a lot of hard work .
The original sentence is grammatically correct . However , if you want to enhance clarity , you could slightly rephrase it . Here ’ s a refined version : Corrected sentence : I am a native Russian speaker and a freelance translator who specializes in technical marketing .
I provide English to Russian translation and cultural adaptation of websites , manuals and user guides , press releases , technical and economic materials , workshops and training programs , multimedia presentations , etc .
I have a sense of style in my native language , which means that the target text will sound appropriate .
A strong technical background allows me to convey an idea of how the device works to the general public without diluting its value for professionals .
I have been working as a full-time freelance translator with the largest Russian and European translation companies , such as Neotech , Logrus , ABBYY , Wessex Translations , and Imprimatur .
I was engaged in a wide variety of projects for different industrial sectors , including the translation of product brochures , specification sheets , event materials , promotional and marketing materials , dealer portal content , training materials , user manuals , dealer manuals , and website content .
Over 10 years of total marketing and sales experience in several auto tire , parts , and accessories companies have given me the opportunity to get on the inside track and learn the automotive business from the inside .

I was responsible for a variety of marketing and e-commerce functions , including the implementation of retail-oriented marketing , advertising , and product programs .
Additional consultations and iterations are included in my service to give you the opportunity to provide feedback on the translation and to receive a revised translation that meets the exact requirements of your customers .
There 's no future for public transport because traveling by car is so much more convenient .
When you travel by car , you can have more privacy , and you can go anywhere , anytime .
It 's more expensive , but it has a lot of advantages .
The public transport is good for the city , but the service is terrible ; you need to wait and there are n't many directions to reach your destination .
Corrected sentence : Do n't have much comfort , and sometimes you have to go without a seat .
Many times , travel by bus is delayed and arrives crowded , wasting time at all bus stops .
The people are different , and they are always different , no matter how much time passes ; the people are different , and they like that .
Corrected sentence : Maybe the poor people have the possibility to buy a car as well ; if it costs a lot of money for them , they will not buy it .
It 's a question of freedom and a conqueror of humanity .
Corrected sentence : No matter the improvements made to public transport , traveling by car is and will be the best choice for a future with more options that are not so rigid and compact , but rather flexible , fast , and convenient .
My favourite sport is yoga , which is a fantastic sport .
I like yoga because it is a relaxing sport that allows us to work our minds and our bodies .
Yoga helps to achieve greater flexibility and improve your concentration .
Corrected sentence : Yoga helps us to live relaxed and accept life as it is .
It allows you to work with the organism using stretching techniques .
Yoga has many benefits , including emotional , spiritual , and moral aspects , that we should learn to embrace in order to better deal with the situations we face on a daily basis .
The advice I would give someone starting this sport is to relax and enjoy the maximum that yoga has to offer you .
According to Lunde , 85 % of homicide victims are killed by someone they know . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Corrected sentence : Yes , the statistics from SC do support this thesis .
These tragedies illustrate the power of frustration over the human body .
People who murder others probably did n't enter the situation wanting to kill the other person .
The person 's frustration led to anger and aggression that got out of control .
Even small things , such as getting in the way of someone 's goals , can lead to frustration , which can result in aggressive acts of murder .
These tragedies also illustrate the flippancy with which we , as Americans , view murder and other forms of violence .
Through exposure , we may have become desensitized to violence .
The media also play a part in this flippancy .
When a character is shot , he often appears in the following scene .
Kids , in particular , are n't forming realistic schemas about violence .
The media also desensitizes men to sex crimes , leading to more rapes .
We , as potential parents , must instill in our children—the future presidents , doctors , teachers , and even murderers—a true picture of aggression and the need to control it .
Racial prejudice is not as pronounced as it was 30 years ago . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
It is actually declining .
This is evidenced , for example , in cartoons and TV shows : racial minorities are not publicly stereotyped .
Attitudes regarding desegregation have also changed—perhaps as a result of the psychology of inevitability and cognitive dissonance .
Perhaps through the media and other sources , some misconceptions are being cleared up , and more realistic information is being provided to the public .
I would suggest that he either focus on the similarities of ideas and opinions with that person 's or genuinely consider presenting his opinions and then converting to the opinions of others .
He should also appear competent but not perfect ( the pratfall effect ) .
He could initially pretend to think negatively of her and then gradually evaluate her more positively ( gain-loss theory ) .
The client should appear as attractive as he can without using his attractiveness to manipulate her .
The client can hope ( particularly if he is of average or lower attractiveness ) that she has moderately low self-esteem and will thus be less selective in her choices for dates or friends .
The client should also disclose personal information .
Corrected sentence : He tried to induce the client to like him .
This advice can be backed up with research .
It would be better for the client to ask a favor from the person ; because of this cognitive dissonance , the other person would view the client as generally more favorable .
In discussing sensitivity , the author emphasizes the importance of being sensitive to one 's own feelings , thoughts , and the effects of one 's own behavior on others .
Only when this is accomplished can he become sensitive to others ' feelings . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
Sensitivity is a necessary component of effective communication . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Confrontation can make one more sensitive to their own behavior and how others interpret it .
One should be sensitive to others ' interpretations of his behavior so that he will know better how to act .
Michael arrived home at 5:45 p.m .
He went straight into his room with a furious expression .
He sat down on his bed and screamed .
After that , he began to smash his belongings .
The original sentence is grammatically correct . However , if you are looking for a slightly refined version for clarity , it could be : Corrected sentence : His mother heard the noise and decided to find out what was happening .
She took the stairs and went into Michael 's room .
She saw things lying around everywhere .
The original sentence `` She asked him why he did it . '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : She asked him why he did it .
Michael , instead of answering , shouted at her .
He and his mother had a clash over something .
A while later , she left the room , leaving the door open . Corrected sentence : A while later , she left the room and left the door open .
At that moment , Michael began to calm down .
He thought about what he had done and let out a sigh . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Genetic manipulation is an area that has caused a great deal of controversy within the scientific field , with a number of advantages and disadvantages .
One of the main advantages is the ability to tailor other organisms ' genetic makeup to meet man 's needs .
The possibilities are endless ; a crop could be designed that would grow in the dry , hot conditions of many third-world countries , relieving them of their worries about starvation .
Cattle that are more efficient at converting plant energy to body mass could be bred , or even diseased cattle could be killed off by altering people 's resistance to them .
Of course , to some extent , genetic manipulation already exists .
Racehorses are bred from certain combinations of parents , and gardeners crossbreed plants to suit their individual needs .
However , there is much opposition to the process of genetic mutation .
The advantages seem very favorable , and I 'm sure that a scientist would take much credit for them .
But would he accept the blame if he caused one of the many disadvantages of genetic manipulation ? Corrected sentence : But would he accept the blame if he caused one of the many disadvantages of genetic manipulation ? ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are necessary . )
Corrected sentence : There are many possibilities for misusing this process .
Corrected sentence : One question is about ethics and morals .
Corrected sentence : Is it right to try to change motives ?
Is it the right of one man to play God ? ( Note : The original sentence is grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
It is also possible that we will not be able to control the new organisms that are created by genetic engineering .
A new plant that has an increased growth rate may seem like an answer to all our problems , but what would we do if it suddenly upset the ecosystem , draining the soil of its nutrients and preventing other plants from growing ?
In theory , a scientist should take responsibility for this , but in an area such as genetic manipulation , of which we do not know a great deal , it may not be possible to find a solution .
Corrected sentence : Another problem is the process of testing .
We are already near the stage where it is possible to test people 's genetic makeup to determine the likelihood of their developing certain illnesses .
Soon it may be possible for firms to employ only people with a certain expected lifespan or for insurance companies to refuse to insure certain individuals on the basis of a genetic test .
Although the threat of the Cold War has diminished , the technology made available from studies into genetic warfare could be dangerous in the wrong hands—particularly in the area of germ warfare .
Although the scientists can take credit for the developments and improvements in the quality of life that their research brings , there are so many disadvantages that they would be forced to take responsibility for the misuse of this new technology .
I 'm so sorry for sending the email too late .
Corrected sentence : It 's nice to hear from you and to read .
The first days of March were terrible because I had a cold and then a toothache for about two weeks .
Corrected sentence : Now I have healed over .
The original sentence `` We are fine . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : We are fine .
I 'm doing my job and studying for my master 's degree .
Corrected sentence : In my master 's first semester , I have been studying lessons in Thin Film Fabrication and Applications , Theoretical Physics , and Diffraction Methods . Theoretical Physics is a little bit boring .
Corrected sentence : I am studying Raman spectroscopy .
I am glad that the weather will be warming the temperature from -4 to +2 degrees Celsius .
The problem is that there is not enough time to learn English .
It 's bad .
I 'm confused , but I know one thing : I must study English .
It had long been discussed that people always learn a big lesson from mistakes .
Some people think there is no room for mistakes in daily life , work , or even in their family .
However , I certainly consider that making mistakes is truly a necessary step in our learning experience .
I am going to share a true story about Michael to support my viewpoint .
Michael was a six-year-old child who lived in the lovely countryside with his parents and his newborn little brother , Tom .
In this small countryside , Michael received all of his parents ' love , attention , and passion .
Corrected sentence : Nonetheless , things went differently until little Tom was born ; Michael suddenly lost all care .
He felt deep despair and tried all his efforts to regain the concern that belonged to him .
In a zoo in the south of France , millions of species live there .
This place is visited daily by many children and adults from that country , as well as from other countries .
One day , some friends from the city where this zoo is located decided to stroll along the river , have a picnic , play football , and spend a good time together .
They were on holiday .
Suddenly , while they were playing football and eating a sandwich each , Max saw a little lion that wanted to attack and take all of their food . Although it was tender to see this situation , Bob was a little scared .
Max was very fond of the animal because he thought it was very small and playful ; otherwise , he and his three friends would never have approached it .
It was dusk in the warm summer of southern France when they saw two security men walking towards them from the great zoo of the city . They looked at each other and said that an animal had escaped from the zoo .
Corrected sentence : Finally , the starry sky and the full night are present in each one of your houses .
He was very exhausted and said , `` What an amazing day !
Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
I 'm so glad to hear that you are coming !
You have no idea how happy I am . ( Corrected sentence : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . )
In connection with your question , I will try to explain how you can reach my house .
There are three possibilities . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Firstly , you can take a taxi , but I must warn you about the taxi drivers .
They 're sly boots , and they could ask you to pay more than it really costs .
Corrected sentence : Secondly , you can take a bus .
Unfortunately , our buses are n't comfortable .
The corrected sentence is : `` The last alternative , which I recommend to you , is my car !
I 'll wait to collect you at the airport , and it wo n't cost you anything .
Since you asked about the best places to visit , I 'd suggest visiting a few places such as Oxford , London , and Piccadilly .
These places are really beautiful !
I 'm sorry I wo n't be able to accompany you on your excursions , as I do not have much free time and need to complete my assignments .
You 're lucky because the museums and galleries are not too far from my house .
You can visit one of the most famous museums in the UK , such as the British Museum .
I recommend seeing the galleries in the Royal Academy of Arts and the National Portrait Gallery .
I 'm certain you will not be disappointed ! ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
I had never felt so nervous before in my life because it was my first time being on stage and singing in front of such a big crowd .
How could I possibly know that some months after that day I would be performing for the president of our country in front of even more people ?
As I walked towards the stage in this hall , feeling every eye piercing me , several things were running through my head .
I thought about losing my consciousness , having a heart attack , or even worse : being called a bad singer by someone in the audience .
At this point , my knees started wobbling , and I felt as if I was walking on pudding .
Whenever I flash back to those moments , which felt like hours , I have no idea how I really managed to get on that stage , but somehow I found myself standing there , slowly reaching for the microphone with my hands shaking as if an earthquake had just occurred .
The moment has come .
I inhaled and could almost feel the air expanding my lungs .
I opened my mouth , tried to calm down , and brought all my concentration to the first note , which did n't come .
Well , it did , but it was not noticeable to anybody .
So I tried again , and suddenly my attitude changed from being a nervous mouse to a woman who loved singing and sharing it with the world .
The melody started to flow , and I happily filled the hall with the music .
Corrected sentence : Like it is said at the top , `` There is no future for public transport because traveling by car is so much more convenient .
Corrected sentence : `` Yes , I agree with that because now people are getting tired of waiting for the bus or any public transport vehicles . Now , personal cars are the preferred option if you want to go ...
I do n't know ... In a place like your holiday house , maybe a bus can not arrive there , and you need a personal car .
If you want to move stuff from one place to a different place , you ca n't do that with a bus ; you need a personal car , so a personal car is better than a public transport vehicle .
The principal aim of this report is to provide the organizers of an international festival with information about the interests of young people in my country .
I am going to write about their interests in music , television programs , and the clothes they are used to wearing , concluding with my personal statement .
Firstly , by conducting a survey among the young people in my area , it emerged that music is essential to them .
In fact , youngsters are inspired by the songs they listen to and the music videos as well .
For the same token , most of those surveyed claimed that their favorite singer was also their idol .
Secondly , young people expressed their interest in television programs such as films and series .
Series have become so popular that numerous teenagers spend at least half of their afternoons watching them on their devices , neglecting schoolwork and extracurricular activities .
Moreover , sometimes young people become obsessed with TV series , and they lose their social lives as well .
Lastly , but not least , youngsters are interested in fashion .
In fact , almost every girl interviewed admitted that she is very keen on being fashionable , and a large number of them claimed that they love having a wide range of clothes in order to show how fancy they are .
In conclusion , I personally think that the next international festival should consider all of these young people 's interests if the organizers want it to be a success .
In the picture , I can see a boy walking two dogs by the seaside .
I think he is about 12 years old .
He is wearing a black and white jacket and black shorts .
He is not wearing shoes .
One dog has brown fur ; its breed is dachshund .
The second dog is white and its breed is Maltese .
The boy is looking at the dogs while leashing them .
It seems that he is happy .
There are some rocks in the sea , and on the beach , there is also a branch lying on the sand .
The weather does n't look very bad , but it 's cloudy and I think it 's not so hot there .
Dear Jo ,
Corrected sentence : First , I would like to thank you for visiting my country .
I am sure that my country is the best option . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )

Next , I am proud to tell you about the beauty of my country . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
There are 54 minorities living together sociably in the `` S '' shaped country .
Corrected sentence : Every minority lands in every region that is different from the others .
My country has not only modern cities but also sparse villages that make you feel a lot of emotion .
Especially , I would have to say that the cuisine is something you should n't miss .
Corrected sentence : Then , despite being a developing country , there are many opportunities to grow your career .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , Vietnam has been attracting foreign investments from many countries .

Finally , I am looking forward to seeing you in my country soon .

A topic that I like very much is electricity .
In today 's world , everybody uses electrical energy for almost everything .
It is present in your personal computer , lamps , and anything that you need to plug in .
Corrected sentence : But almost no one knows that the electricity travels a long way to arrive in your houses .
The journey starts in the plant of energy , wherein the electricity is generated by resources like water , wind , solar energy , nuclear energy , and other methods .
Corrected sentence : Then , the electrical energy travels to the substation .
After this , the electrical energy needs to lose a little bit of energy to arrive at your house without any troubles , and this occurs in a place called a substation .
Therefore , we need to think very carefully before wasting energy .
Corrected sentence : Because it is an expensive cost for you and primarily for the environment .
It seems that the sentence you provided is simply the word `` ESSAY , '' which does not contain any grammatical errors or context to correct . If you have a specific sentence that contains grammatical errors , please provide it , and I would be happy to help you identify and correct those mistakes !
It is widely known that the majority of teenagers are keen on video games . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
Some people believe that it 's a waste of time and a bad habit , while others think that it 's a good way to spend their free time .
To my mind , there are pros and cons .
First of all , computer games can help you escape from your busy schedule and get some rest and relaxation after school .
Corrected sentence : Apart from that , it is quite convenient , mainly because you can stay at home and have entertainment .
Also , video games are more interesting than traditional toys , so they capture teenagers ' interest .
Last but not least , some of them are educational and provide you with the ideal opportunity to gain knowledge .
On the other hand , there are many drawbacks . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No corrections are needed . )
To begin , when you spend a lot of hours in front of the computer screen , you become addicted to it .
As a result , you do n't get together with your friends , and you do n't communicate face-to-face .
In addition , a lot of video games are full of violence , and teens tend to imitate them , which can lead to violent and aggressive behavior .
Corrected sentence : Additionally , playing video games for hours can be very harmful to your eyes .
In conclusion , computer games are a nice way to spend your free time , but always in moderation .
I feel that the invention of the computer has significantly changed people 's lives .
This , realistically , has been quite a new invention , and in its short lifespan , it has been able to change the world significantly .
Not to mention how it will change people 's lifestyles in the future .
These changes resulting from the invention of the computer have been , I feel , both bad and good .
Corrected sentence : Technologically , computers have drastically improved people 's lives .
No longer are the times when people must write a paper manually or even with a simple typewriter .
Personal computers are becoming quite common ; therefore , they are less expensive and easier to own .
Corrected sentence : Computers have also made life transpire much quicker than before .
Gone are the days when a person who wanted money from a bank had to wait until it was open . Corrected sentence : Gone are the days when a person who wants money from a bank has to wait until it is open .
We now have ATMs , automatic teller machines , that are able to perform the same transactions as a teller would .
It seems that these days , everything is run by computers !
We are able to complete our tasks much better and more efficiently .
Corrected sentence : Basically , every facet of life has been affected by computers , bringing about positive results .
While computers have brought about improvements , in my opinion , they have also `` impersonalized '' the world .
Jobs are being taken away from humans who are not `` fast enough .
Interaction with humans in some places is extinct .
Yes , it might be more efficient to have a computer make your transaction at a bank , but I miss the human interaction between people .
In addition , it is very dangerous to place all of one 's trust in a machine .
Corrected sentence : It is a common fact that machines do fail !
Sure , a car with a computer that tells the driver when an oncoming obstacle is approaching is safe , but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own judgment ?
People soon stop thinking and allow machines to do the work for them .
I feel afraid when our society relies so heavily on a network of wires .
Computers are not able to express or truly feel emotions , and therefore are incapable , in some instances , of functioning .
With the invention of the computer come many changes , from the lifestyle of the past to changes in the lifestyle of the future .
Some of these changes will save people 's lives , such as advances in medical technology and safety .
Corrected sentence : But I fear that our world will become a very impersonal place . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
I hope that we will be able to determine what improvements should be made and what should simply remain `` slow .
Dear Mrs. Ashby ,
I am writing to apply for one of the positions at your café .
I saw an advertisement for this job near my house .
I have the right qualifications for this job ; for instance , I have taken courses in cooking , and I am interested in all kinds of food .
Furthermore , I am very good at dealing with people . Last summer , I attended as a guide at a museum .
I am very hardworking , enjoy working with other people , and I am willing to work as much as you need .
I would like the opportunity to work in a café .
The original sentence is grammatically correct . However , if you want to enhance clarity or style , you could consider a slight rephrasing . Here ’ s a refined version : Corrected sentence : I am a sociable person , and I enjoy working with others .
In addition , this job would offer me more experience in my chosen professional field since I want to apply in the future as a chef in a restaurant .
I am available for an interview at any time .
I am looking forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience .
The original sentence is already grammatically correct . However , if you are looking for a slightly more concise version , you could say : '' Please feel free to contact me if you need any further information . '' But the original sentence is perfectly acceptable as it stands .
I can be contacted at 0741123456 at any hour .
Corrected sentence : Yours faithfully ,

I would like to recommend Mzoli 's restaurant .
It is a place that is located in the heart of Warsaw .
A lot of foreigners go there to try delicious traditional South African grilled food .
It is rather an informal restaurant , designed in a rustic style that guarantees a really nice ambiance .
When it comes to food , you can try all kinds of grilled meats , even the most exotic ones .
About the service , I can call it unusual because you choose your meat , and the staff prepares your dish . Then , you go to the kitchen to get your dish and eat it with your hands .
I have been there once , and I really liked that place ; you feel at home , and the food is delicious .
The price is also the lowest I could find in this country .
The main reason I like that place is that I can see many different people from various parts of the world .
I have been there several times , but I would still like to go there again with my classmates .
The best film .
I am a fan club for the film that calls itself High School Musical fans .
High School Musical is the best film I could see in the world .
Corrected sentence : When you see the thriller , you can stop looking for it , and immediately you will want to see the film .
It 's a move that everyone could see .
I think I find it exciting because I love all films like them .
This great move is about a group of people who go to secondary school . This school is not like all schools ; it is different because you have a lot of activities like basketball , theater , etc .
I think that people would like to see it because when you watch , you can stop it , and you have a lot of music , songs , and people dancing .
In my opinion , it 's the best film I 've seen in my life , and if you have the opportunity to see it , do so .
The reason fox hunting should be banned is that it is a cruel sport .
There are many people trying to stop the sport from taking place .
The reason people kill and hunt foxes is that they kill chickens and enjoy the social side of the sport .
In this present time , I am sure farmers can come up with some ideas to prevent the fox from getting at their chickens .
If they did this , then there would not be a need for killing foxes and going on hunts .
When hunts take place , other wildlife is harmed as well as the foxes .
Some homes of animals may be destroyed , and some innocent animals may be harmed .
Once the foxes are caught , it is said that they suffer a horrible death , and if this continues , it will be unfair .
Many people have no problems with foxes , and the hunt should not be included as a sport , as it will not be fun to experience .
If fewer foxes are killed , it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops , so this will benefit many farmers . This is not cruel ; it is just the way of life .
Fox hunting is a horrible sport because the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback .
The fox is then chased until it is caught . ( Corrected sentence : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . )
Thinking about this is very upsetting , and most people would be relieved if fox hunting were banned .
Corrected sentence : Foxes have as much right on this earth as we do , and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way .
I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt , so I do not see why we should put foxes through it .
If foxes are unable to harm farm animals , there is not a danger in banning the sport .
The reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the number of foxes down and not cause a change in the food chain .
Foxes are not needed to keep down the rabbit population , as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits .
If you ban fox hunting , it means that the protesters will have won , and this gives them the incentive to protest about something else .
A few people enjoy the sport and it allows them to socialize .
I believe that fox hunting should be banned , as it is very cruel .
Another reason why it should not be banned is that foxes give chickens a cruel death when they kill them .
If they decide they have to continue the sport because they need to kill the foxes , then the sport should be banned , and a more humane method of euthanasia should be considered .

This report will address whether cars should be banned from the centers of all major cities .
The number of cars has increased in countries in the last decade .
Too many cars running around people can be a serious problem to deal with .

Corrected sentence : There are some advantages and disadvantages .

First , there would be less noise in the streets .
In particular , in Spain , where city centers are usually quite narrow .
Corrected sentence : Second , there will be less air pollution .
It has been proven that too much smog in the atmosphere is harmful to health .
Corrected sentence : Third , cities would be friendlier places to live .
Corrected sentence : Places where people can enjoy walking around .
It seems that the provided sentence `` Cons '' is incomplete and lacks context . To correct it , I would need more information about what you intend to convey . If `` Cons '' is meant to refer to the disadvantages of something , a possible corrected version could be : '' Cons : '' If you meant to list the cons of a specific topic , you could say : '' The cons of this approach are ... '' Please provide more context or a complete sentence for a more accurate correction !
First , local sellers ' work could be damaged in that area because they may need to upload and download goods for the shops .
Second , people who live in that part of the city could be negatively affected because they may need to pass through it with some cars in order to get home .
In my opinion , it would be a good idea to do it , but we would need to balance different interests in order to do it right .
There is an opinion that computers will replace books in the future .
I believe that it is true because computers are more convenient and easier to use .
Tablets are light , and you can give only them without carrying many heavy books .
Corrected sentence : It is common knowledge that gadgets make our lives easier .
Corrected sentence : But some people have a different opinion about it .
Firstly , studying at school has become simple ; students can find a lot of different information about interesting topics .
The original sentence `` I do n't know where to start . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I do n't know where to start .
I 'm only going to bare my heart to my computer . Corrected sentence : I 'm only going to bare my heart to my computer . ( Note : The original sentence is grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
Corrected sentence : Because I feel lonely .
Corrected sentence : And I do n't know exactly what I need , and I do n't know definitely what I should do .
Corrected sentence : But I understand that I definitely need some changes in my life .
I wish some really pleasant and enjoyable events would burst into my life .
It must happen , I 'm sure .
The question is how long I have to keep waiting .
My patience is already running out .
I refuse to understand and accept the fact that I ca n't afford a luxurious life for myself .
Yes , I have always dreamed of wealth .
I am not a greedy , avaricious person .
I only want my wishes to be fulfilled .
I do not have many desires in my mind .
I only wish my most favorite loved ones are healthy , wealthy , and happy .
I wish my daughters , my husband , and I were traveling a lot ; we love each other and have enough money for everything we want .
The Single European Act , signed in February 1986 by the Heads of Government of the 12 Member States of the European Community and which came into force on 1st July 1987 , aims to create a single market by the end of the year 1992 .
This major target is to be attained by removing all fiscal , technical , and physical barriers .
This means that a merchant or tradesman would be able to sell his goods in any member country , an individual would be able to borrow and deposit money in the banks of any member state , and also work in any member state with national qualifications .
There will also be the introduction of a European passport and an integrated transport system .
Despite the fact that the proposals put forward to amend the Treaty of Rome came from an Englishman , namely Lord Cofield , there has been widespread dissatisfaction in Britain regarding the single market , as shown by frequent discussions in Parliament and letters to leading national newspapers . Meanwhile , Jacques Delors , the president of the European Commission , described the measures adopted as a mere compromise .
In accordance with the constitutional law of Britain , Parliament is the supreme law-making body in the United Kingdom .
Consequently , the emergence of another source of law , deemed to be supra-national , is inevitably a problem .
Corrected sentence : One of the prerogative powers conferred upon Parliament is the right to make treaties . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
However , these treaties are not directly effective on British individuals , so that where a treaty contains provisions giving rights and duties to an individual , he can not place reliance upon the treaty until it is substantially incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom by an Act of Parliament .
This acts as a curb on the enforcement of European Community Law , so that to a certain extent , a degree of sovereignty is retained .
Yet , this is not as advantageous as it may at first appear , for there is a general judicial presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate contrary to European Community Law .
Personally , I think that although the integration of Britain into Europe will be beneficial in many areas , such as freedom of transportation , movement , work , and other realms , there are also many disadvantages , including the loss of sovereignty to a certain extent .
Although the British Parliament will continue to regulate the acts or omissions of individuals on a personal basis , such as in Criminal Law , its freedom to legislate in the domain of public law will be severely restricted .
Not only will Parliament be obliged to enforce Community Law , but any later statutes passed by the British Parliament will also be construed in the light of Community provisions or declared invalid .
To conclude , it is feasible to imply that the sovereignty of Britain will be impaired in many ways , although only within the sphere of Community Law , which prevails over national law .
In other senses , the sovereignty of Britain will be safeguarded , for Parliament will still reign supreme within the United Kingdom .
The turn of the century has brought many changes that have greatly altered lives around the globe .
Each decade , in itself , has introduced a new `` fad '' or discovery that has been fixed in our minds as `` typical '' of the era .
The `` Roaring 20s , '' for example , was marked by flapper skirts and the invention of the automobile .
A very capricious decade , it can be contrasted with the years of hunger and unemployment that marked the `` Great Depression '' of the 1930s .
How could we ever forget the `` Fabulous Fifties '' or the hippie decades of the '60s and '70s ?
Corrected sentence : Change is inevitable , and as difficult as it may be to pinpoint any one accomplishment that has taken place over the last 100 years as the most remarkable of the century , there is one aspect of the 20th century that will remain with me forever .
So , as we embark on the year 2000 , I think it is only fair to call the 20th century `` The Century of Democracy .
Corrected sentence : Perhaps it is because today is November 4th , the day after the U.S. elections .
Corrected sentence : Perhaps it is because the former superpower , the Soviet Union , is now making its transition to a democracy .
Corrected sentence : Perhaps it is because I am thousands of miles from home , but I 'm feeling very patriotic these days .
No , I 'm not engulfed in the typical ethnocentric idealism of a citizen of the United States .
Rather , I 'm feeling patriotic because I can look around the world today and see that it is becoming a better place to live for people of all nations . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
In the past two years alone , we have seen people all over the world finally take a stand for what they believe in .
Not too long ago , I remembered the democratic demonstrations that caused the people of East and West Germany to unite as one democratic superpower .
At the World Expo in Sevilla , not a month ago , I bought a chunk of what was once the Berlin Wall—the Wall that was a symbol to many of the harsh realities of the Cold War .
That wall is gone forever , and I feel lucky to be among the many who witnessed its disappearance .
The Soviet Union , as well , is going through its own transition to democracy .
The many unhappy people of this troubled nation finally took it upon themselves to rid their country of its communist government .
The superpower among superpowers that , to me , had long been the example of Marxism is now following in the footsteps of the rest of the world .
With the end of the Cold War , there have been more peaceful relations throughout the world .
The idea of a nuclear war is practically non-existent today .
Arms sales have gone down so that nations can spend this money in more worthwhile areas .
In conclusion , as the turn of the century slowly approaches , I look back with a feeling of accomplishment as well as anticipation for what lies ahead .
Corrected sentence : As a world of many scattered nations , conflicts are inevitable .
However , if we all have one bond—democracy—then maybe together we can learn to understand one another and work towards a happier world for all .
It is a well-known fact that everybody needs holidays .
To begin with this topic , we need to ask ourselves about several matters to keep in mind .
Firstly , we must be aware of our economic situation , the season we are in , the people accompanying us , the transport , the accommodation , the location , and other matters that we should consider when we decide to go on holiday .
Secondly , we should consider two main options : going abroad or staying around our home .
This could be the first question that we wonder about before going on holiday .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , due to globalization and the increased number of flights around the world , we can find a wide range of webpages where flight companies offer their services at incredibly low prices .
Corrected sentence : Because of these low prices , many people decide to go abroad instead of traveling near their homes .
Of course , in order to prepare for a good trip , you must also consider the accommodation , the food , etc. , and depending on the place you choose , you will spend more or less money .
Another point to consider is the environment . If you go abroad , you can visit well-known typical monuments and historical natural sites around the world . If you stay in your country , while you can certainly see many places , the options are limited .
In conclusion , I think one must consider several points when planning a holiday trip , and it depends on their knowledge about where to go and how to determine if one trip could be cheaper or more expensive .
Dear Sir ,
My name is Tomas García , and I am writing regarding the advertisement that appeared in the newspaper yesterday about the summer camp job .
I am 25 years old and I come from Spain .
My mother tongue is Spanish , but I can speak English fluently too .
Corrected sentence : Besides , as you can see from my enclosed CV , I studied for a Law Degree and worked in companies such as ... and ... , in jobs very similar to the one you are offering .
That is why I consider that my experience and qualifications fit very well with this position 's requirements .
Moreover , I would especially like to point out that I have always been interested in working with people , particularly in taking care of little children and helping them to be happy .
For all these reasons , I consider myself a very suitable candidate for this position , and I would appreciate the opportunity to come in for an interview and discuss this vacancy with you further .
My contact information is in the attached CV , at your convenience .
The original sentence `` I look forward to hearing from you . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I look forward to hearing from you .
Corrected sentence : Yours sincerely .
The European Community is a grouping of 12 sovereign European states whose intention is to develop closer economic and political cooperation .
Corrected sentence : Its intention is to encourage greater freedom of movement of goods , services , capital , and the workforce .
The competition for trade in modern times is so great that Britain has no choice but to join Europe in order to increase the market for its goods .
Britain has been recognized for having a particular skill in the areas of banking and insurance .
The European market will give us the opportunity to use this skill in a far wider market .
The creation of one European commercial market will also benefit consumers since a homogenization of standards is in the process of being introduced , hopefully to the highest common denominator .
The European Union does not serve only as a useful trade association ; however , environmental problems can be tackled more effectively if the European community confronts such problems together .
Cooperation between the community police forces will assist in overcoming the problems of drug smuggling and terrorism .
The common defense policy for such a large area of Europe would also be beneficial and possibly less costly if the member states pooled their resources .
However , some loss of national sovereignty will inevitably occur .
The Single European Act was designed to speed up the decision-making of certain institutions .
The act meant that member governments had to be committed to the greatest cooperation and joint action in the areas of foreign , social , and environmental policy , thus leaving less room for differences of opinion among the members .
The decisions of the European Court of Justice already take precedence over national law , which can be seen as a major infringement on our national sovereignty .
More participation in the election of members of the European Parliament would help elect those best suited to promote British interests in Europe .
The question is how much sovereignty Britain is prepared to lose and whether the benefits of belonging to a single Europe outweigh the disadvantages .
A certain loss of sovereignty has already been felt , and in the next few years , this will increase .
As far as the immediate future is concerned , a certain loss of sovereignty is the price we have to pay for material progress .
In most of the earlier studies , the effects of either ocean acidification or warming have been investigated at one time .
However , in nature , these stressors affect the organism collectively , and the effect could be greater than that of a single stressor .
I remember how the old people interacted with their children .
They were all poor ; they did n't have enough money to pay for their children 's education .
All the children should help their parents .
Some of them have been adopted by other parents .
The children wanted to receive an education , but they do n't have enough money to pay .
Some of the children were working in the sugar cane field , while others worked in a shop to earn money to feed themselves , and they had many good people who were well-mannered .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , many people have changed their lifestyle .
Corrected sentence : And their lives have become birds in the sky .
Some of them have already achieved their life .
They have plenty of money , and their children have all that they want , but some of the children have very bad manners .
They do n't respect their parents , and they do not wonder what they did .
Some of them have already given birth to a child at the age of sixteen or gotten married .
The world has already changed now .
They have good doctors who are qualified and have great skills .
Corrected sentence : Many people developed their own countries .
For example , they want to attract more and more tourists to their country .
Some of the children who are eighteen years old have already left their homes to live with their girlfriends .
They did not remember what their parents had done for them .
The people have changed their lifestyle .
Corrected sentence : Some of the boys like to get a new hairstyle .
Just like girls , they like to bring many accessories with them , such as makeup .
They want to create a new fashion to establish a name for themselves .
People became more skilled and also more ill-mannered .
The next 50 years , people can create many electronic things , such as cars and machines like televisions .
The television has brought many advantages that could never have been envisaged by our great-grandparents .
Corrected sentence : People will develop more television models .
Year by year , the world will change and become more developed .
Long ago , the early cars had wooden bodies , which made them extremely vulnerable in the event of a crash .
Corrected sentence : About 30 years ago , cars have switched to all-steel bodies .
Today , cars are stronger , lighter , and safer than earlier designs .
Corrected sentence : It means that today people are creating more new features .
The television is an interesting source of information that people see every day . It has one comedy program and also covers quantum physics . The television is a subject of study if you propose it ; it is merely a tool in your investigation .
If you arrive in the morning , you will have access to TV news , which has good ratings , and everyone needs to be informed about the world day after day .
If you enter in the afternoon , you have kids or young people , but what they really have an interest in regarding this proposal is that all people want to see soap operas at this hour and want to watch comedies or interesting documentaries about whatever we want .
Hi Ana ,
Yes , I am currently in the process of learning English .
By coincidence , I work in the IT sphere now ; therefore , I need this language for my daily communication with customers .
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions .
Corrected sentence : Thank you .
It seems that the sentence provided is incomplete , as it only contains the name `` Alex . '' Please provide a complete sentence that contains grammatical errors , and I will be happy to help you identify and correct them .
The original sentence `` I do n't agree . '' is already grammatically correct . There are no errors to correct . Corrected sentence : I do n't agree .
I think the future is public transport .
Corrected sentence : Also , I think this applies to many things .
Now we live in a shared world , where everything is shared : work , development , ideas , and many other things .
This is a new philosophy . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
The base of this philosophy is `` sharing .
This idea brings great benefits to all .
Corrected sentence : It is the same case for the transport .
If we shared transport , public transport could be lower , cars would therefore cause less pollution , and there would be less traffic .
Corrected sentence : Everybody saves money , and the familiar economy is better .
The cities become more agile and are easier to get to the places .
This model has many advantages .
To solve the problem of the traditional model , we need to address the fact that traffic is worse during peak times , and the travel time for both modes of transport can become significantly longer and more frustrating . While personal transport is generally more comfortable and quicker , relying on only one mode of transport would be more efficient and comfortable for everyone .
I think the whole world would benefit : the environment , people , families , work , and so on .
I agree with this statement . I think the future will be such that everyone will have their own car and they wo n't use public transport .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , every person wants to live conveniently for themselves .
So they just buy a new car for your use .
Corrected sentence : However , some people can not buy it .
Corrected sentence : Because they have n't got enough money and they have a material problem .
Corrected sentence : So they account for using public transport .
Corrected sentence : There is an untouchability towards poor people .
In my opinion , using public transport will not be as popular as traveling by car .
In my opinion , public transport has a bright future because many people live in big cities and do not use cars to get around ; instead , they find public transport more comfortable . They can take the bus , then the underground , and finally arrive anywhere they want .
Corrected sentence : But if they use the car , they will probably be late for the place they are going .
I think that if people use public transport , there will be less pollution , and the sky in the city should be blue instead of gray , so no one should say that public transport does n't have a future .
Moreover , a lot of people use public transport because they do n't have a car .
In conclusion , nowadays people are very conscious about the environment , which can be affected by cars , and they do n't use their cars a lot , so I think that is n't the end for public transport .
Today we see a lot of television . I think that it is not a great result ; due to watching more television , you can become lazy .
In addition , most of these programs are stupid , good only for wasting your time .
The reason is that a lot of people do n't want to receive bad news ; they only want to be entertained .
Fortunately , not all TV channels have these programs .
There is somebody who tries to invent new programs aimed at educating people .
One of these is Channel 5 . During the day , it transmits some interesting programs about history and nature .
I strongly believe that it 's possible to do both programs .
For example , during the day , it 's possible to mix sending news and quiz programs with documentaries and interviews .
If we have channel programs like these , I am sure that all the Italian citizens could benefit and gain more knowledge about our beautiful world .
Dear Alison ,
How are you doing ? I am writing to let you know about the eating habits and customs in my country .
In Argentina , the most typical foods are empanadas , mate , and dulce de leche .
I am one hundred percent sure that everyone in this country has already tried empanadas at least once .
The original sentence is grammatically correct . However , if you are looking for a slightly refined version for clarity , it could be : Corrected sentence : We usually have breakfast right after we wake up .
Most people usually drink chocolate milk and eat biscuits for breakfast .
We also have tea time , and we eat similarly to how we do in the morning . I know it may sound kind of weird to you ! We have lunch at twelve o'clock and dinner around ten .
What really makes a traditional Sunday in Argentina is the food , most commonly the barbecue , enjoyed with the whole family .
It is a custom that I hope I will never lose . You should come to visit me and experience it for yourself ; I am sure you will love it !
I hope my letter has helped you ! ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
Corrected sentence : Best wishes !
It seems that the sentence you provided is incomplete or lacks context . `` Belu '' appears to be a name or a fragment rather than a complete sentence . If you could provide a more complete sentence or additional context , I would be happy to help identify and correct any grammatical errors .
Lots of people believe that sooner or later public transport will lose its important role .
Corrected sentence : First of all , due to the fact that traveling by car is much more convenient .
Actually , you can use your vehicle not only to get to the office or reach the shopping mall , but also to go on holiday without having to stand in a queue before catching a train , plane , or bus .
Actually , there are lots of traffic jams , and it is quite common to be stuck along the road .
But it could be quite the same for traveling by bus and other means of transport .
Secondly , cars are becoming cheaper day by day , so everyone can afford to buy one , even those who are not considered wealthy .
So far , public transport has been considered relatively cheap , environmentally friendly , and fast .
On the one hand , we can not forget that cars have a negative impact on air quality and that they are one of the most significant causes of pollution .
On the other hand , everyone is more or less aware that airline companies have a great impact on air pollution .
Anyway , it could be possible to travel by car , and when you arrive at a certain destination , you can choose to cycle or walk instead of taking buses , trains , the underground , or other public means of transport .
Cycling or walking could be even better than public transport : much healthier , cheaper , and faster .
We must also take into consideration the fact that the car industry has developed many new vehicles .
There are now new models available , for example , electric cars , that are environmentally friendly ; they are not so expensive , so everyone can buy one .
In conclusion , I strongly believe that there is no future for public transport and that traveling by car will become faster , cheaper , and even less environmentally harmful day by day .
I think doing sports is healthy .
When we do sports , we feel better ; our body and mind are healthy .
My favorite sport is yoga .
The original sentence `` I go to the gym three times a week . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I go to the gym three times a week .
I love it because when the class finishes , I feel well .
Corrected sentence : I sometimes take my dog for a walk in the forest .
I walked the Santiago Way 10 years ago .
Corrected sentence : I like it very much .
I walked 760 kilometers .
I started in Roncesvalles and finished in Santiago de Compostela .
This way is very beautiful .
I met a lot of people from other countries , such as Brazil , Germany , and Australia .
Car might be more comfortable , but it is still riskier than the train or bus .
I prefer to use my private car because of the long distance between my home and my company 's location .
Michael was just sitting there , wondering what would come next in his life .
Time passed , but the answers still did not come to him ; that was the moment he decided to make things happen .
He took a bag filled with clothes and snacks ; no matter what , this would become the adventure of his life—a new beginning .
He walked outside his home and took the very first cab he saw .
Corrected sentence : `` Nowhere was written in bold black letters on a sign in the front window of that cab .
He started to wonder about the infinite choices he had ahead .
Just take me to a bar , '' he thought to himself , `` but no , that was too simple .
Take me to the airport , '' he repeated in his mind , but no , that is too crazy .
Just drive ; it does n't matter where , '' he said to the taxi driver , whispering to his feet , `` maybe I should not run away .
He felt the guilt of leaving the very second he grabbed the cab door .
Corrected sentence : It was because of his wife ?
Corrected sentence : No , there is no error in the sentence .
Corrected sentence : Was it because of her daughter ?
Corrected sentence : No , there is no need for further discussion .
Corrected sentence : It was because of his poorly paid job .
Corrected sentence : No .
It was because he did not have the courage before ; it was selfish and incorrect .
Corrected sentence : But the question running through his mind was : `` Does that really matter ?
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Corrected sentence : It is true that traveling by car is much more convenient than traveling by public transport .
But at the same time , it also consumes much more energy than traveling by public transport .
Rather than saying that there is no future for public transport .
I think it is more accurate to say that there 's no future for individual auto transport .
Due to global warming , many countries , including Taiwan , Turkey , and Germany , have started to promote public transport in order to protect our environment .
Their government tries to increase oil prices and decrease public transport fares .
Although the government tries to make us use more public transport .
I think there is still a limited impact on our society .
The most efficient way is to promote it ourselves .
Corrected sentence : If we all start to use public transport and tell people how good it is for our planet .
I guess more people will start doing it .
The original sentence `` SOCIAL NETWORKS '' does not contain any grammatical errors , but it is incomplete as it lacks context or a verb . If you intended to provide a more complete thought or statement about social networks , please provide additional context . For example , if you meant to say something like `` Social networks are important for communication , '' that would be a complete and corrected version . If you have a specific sentence in mind that needs correction , please provide it , and I will be happy to assist !
If you want to talk with your friends , share photos , or post anything you want , you have many opportunities to do so on social media sites .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , people use the Internet to do anything—from obtaining information to sharing photos , uploading videos , and other useful activities .
Corrected sentence : So , social networks are now very widespread on the internet .
The most popular social networks are Facebook , Twitter , Yahoo , Flickr , WhatsApp , Tumblr , Ask.fm , and so on .
Corrected sentence : Let 's use Facebook as an example .
Facebook is the biggest and most used social network .
It has more than one billion users .
You can use a Facebook account to text your friends , keep in touch with them , share your own experiences , receive notifications , upload photos and videos , and of course , see what your friends post .
You can also see what their opinions are and what 's new in politics , business , and entertainment .
You can promote your own business so that your products and services can more easily find their target .
Facebook has many benefits , but at the same time , it can be very dangerous !
Corrected sentence : There are so many people on the internet who pretend to be someone else .
Now , let me tell you my `` Facebook story .
When I was 11 years old , I created my first Facebook account .
The original sentence `` I was so excited about it ! '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : I was so excited about it !
I felt like I had just discovered the technology .
I started posting photos of myself , sharing videos , updating my status , and meeting new people .
Then , I was thinking that it 's `` cooler '' to write on Facebook that I live in the Netherlands and work at Jack Daniel 's .
I remember that I used to answer everyone , no matter who they were .
I talked with Romanian , Indian , Arabian people , and other strangers .
I did n't realize I was in danger .
Two years later , when I was 13 years old , I started to realize that my old photos , videos , and statuses were completely stupid , and I decided to delete them all !
I have also changed my workplace and my country , and I deleted unknown people from my `` friends list , '' but I made a really big mistake : I made my phone number public !
One week later , after making my phone number public , I was called by a lot of strangers , and some of them were using a private number .
I really do n't like it !
Now , I 'm 15 years old , and I think I 'm mature enough to use Facebook . I have learned a lot from the big mistakes I have made on Facebook up until now .
I do n't accept friend requests from people I do n't know ; I do n't talk to strangers , I do n't give my personal details ( especially my phone number ) , and I think twice before posting something .
I 'm thinking now : What was in my mind when I was talking to strangers ?
Oh my God , I was in really big danger !
So , I want to give you some advice : Do n't let your kids access Facebook if they are under 13 years old because they can be very naive , and psychos , rapists , etc . are everywhere on the Internet .
In my opinion , social networks can be useful if you know how to use them , as long as you do n't let them control you .
The original sentence `` I have a dream . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I have a dream .
It seems big or not ; I do n't know .
Corrected sentence : But I really want to make it come true .
My dream originates from Messi . I do n't know how , but Messi is my inspiration , maybe .
He gave me a dream to go abroad .
Corrected sentence : I will meet him then .
Corrected sentence : Yes .
Corrected sentence : He is also my motive .
Corrected sentence : Young people are focusing on health and fitness .
Nowadays , there 's a great deal of information available both on the Internet and on TV about how we need to be fit and why it 's so important to stay healthy .
Corrected sentence : However , are young people aware of this fact ?
I consider that most of them do n't pay enough attention to their health and fitness since they spend a lot of time drinking alcohol and smoking .
In spite of going to the gym , they behave badly on the weekends when they go clubbing , for example .
On the other hand , I consider that there are a large number of young people who have fun without drugs and alcohol .
They also go to the gym , play sports , and follow a healthy diet .
In my opinion , you need to be fit to stay healthy .
You should be on a diet and exercise .
If you do that , your body will act better than you expect .
Our lifestyle regrettably involves going to the gym to get fit , but also going out to drink alcohol .
Both are impossible . Corrected sentence : Both options are impossible .
Corrected sentence : Hey , it 's me , Satyajit .
The original sentence `` I am a student . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I am a student .
I am going to appear for the JEE MAIN entrance exam in Bhubaneswar , Odisha , India .
I am a fan of SRK . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
I love you , Simpy ...
Corrected sentence : Would you like to come ?
Wawel - Managing Center of the old capital city
Wawel was once one of the most important places in Central Europe during the Middle Ages .
There lived and led the bravest Polish king and leaders at a time when Poland was once one of the strongest countries in the world and the strongest in Central Europe .
Recent Wawel is the number one place in Kraków for visitors because , apart from its rich history , we can find beautiful monuments , works of art , and obviously , we can gain a lot of interesting information on a tour with a guide .
Apart from tourism , the history of Wawel is being created recently ; there we can visit the cemetery , where the most famous leaders of Poland , such as Jan III Sobieski , Józef Piłsudski , and Lech Kaczyński , who was President of Poland recently , are located .
In conclusion , Wawel is a place worth visiting if you are planning to visit southern Poland . The revitalization of Kraków city is also beautiful , so everything matches well together .
People who are planning to see Wawel should n't forget about the other interesting places around Wawel , like Sukiennice , Smok Wawelski , and many wonderful temples—everything is no further than several hundred meters from Wawel .
Dear Jen ,
Last week , I went on an educational trip with some students from the same class , along with my class adviser .
The original sentence `` We visited the National Museum . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : We visited the National Museum .
It was nice to see the old relics that were preserved for a long time , as well as those relics that are being used today to help us learn about what happened in the past .
After the trip , we had our lunch at a nearby food chain .
The original sentence `` We enjoyed discussing the trip . '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : We enjoyed discussing the trip .
Corrected sentence : It was the day before yesterday , but Michael did not know it yet .
He just knew that he had to get to work on the novel he so desperately wanted to finish , but he had not managed to complete a single chapter of it so far .
He placed himself in front of the oak desk , opened his silver laptop , and stared at the white , blank page of the document in front of him .
He did not know what to write , even though he knew the story , the characters , the plot , and the twists at the end .
He knew the complexity , essence , feel , and every last detail of what he wanted to write . Corrected sentence : He knew the complexity , essence , feel , and every last detail of what he wanted to write . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are necessary . )
Suddenly , he felt his mind running in circles , spiraling into the unknown , his fingers blazing over the keyboard faster than he had ever done before , and the words assembled , gathered , and became sentences—structured organizations of semantic meaning—and suddenly , the chapter was finished .
He had no doubt that the inspiration came from above .
He closed the writing program , and when asked whether or not to save the changes , he pressed `` Do n't Save , '' as he always did after not writing anything . Then , he put on his jacket to go for a walk to celebrate .
He went out the door , turned on his heel , and looked at his computer with a strange sensation in his stomach .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Corrected sentence : Hello , my name is Roll .
I was born in Danderyds Sjukhus in 2000 .
I have a brother , Trogen .
He is 13 years old . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
My favorite sport is ice hockey . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
I am playing in the SDE hockey team .
I started playing ice hockey when I was 6 years old .
I think my favorite place is Tigerbalsamhallen , where I play hockey because I love playing hockey .
Three words that describe me are happy , hockey , and friends .
I do not have a favorite movie . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
I like many movies , and I feel the same way about songs .
I like house music , and one of my favorite artists is Avicii .
I do n't want to miss `` Partaj '' because it is so funny .
Kebabs are my favorite food .
My favorite restaurant is Nico 's Pizzeria because it has the best kebab .
One of my favorite memories is when I was in New York and watched the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden .
Dear Sir ,
I am writing in regard to your request for recommendations on places to visit for your students .
To be honest , four hours is not much when it comes to sightseeing in my city , and I have been thinking about it a lot . In the end , I think I may have come up with a perfect idea .
I do not know if you have heard about our old castle .
It 's in the very center of the town , so it is very close to the hostel where you are staying .
We can visit it ; it is open from eight till twelve ( I checked ) , and they have wonderful exhibitions there—paintings , sculptures , something from history , and a little bit more modern as well .
The best part is that at 1 p.m. , there is going to be a concert .
My friends from a school of music will be playing old instruments as an accompaniment to the slideshow of old photographs from the 19th century .
I think the best plan would be for us to go together at ten in the morning , see some paintings for two hours , then go for ice cream or pizza , or whatever the kids would like to have during the break , and then get back to the castle for the show .
Later , we can do whatever you would like to do .
If you have any questions , just write to me or call me on my cellphone at 123-456 .
Corrected sentence : Yours faithfully ,
The sentence `` Sevastian Duźniak '' does not contain any grammatical errors , as it appears to be a proper noun ( a name ) . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : Sevastian Duźniak
When I started to think about my favorite sport , it was quite difficult for me to decide since I 'm very keen on practicing sports .
As long as I can remember , I 've always been engaged in sports .
Nevertheless , if I had to choose one among all of them , running could be considered my favorite .
Running is one of the cheapest and easiest sports to practice anywhere and at any time .
The only thing you need to do is just feel like spending half an hour breathing fresh air and relaxing .
An issue that is becoming increasingly debated is whether fox hunting should be banned .
In today 's society , it is an outdated and barbaric `` sport '' that , in my opinion , should be banned .
In this country , animal rights have been debated in Parliament , and many measures have been implemented to safeguard animals ' welfare .
Recently , the British government has brought in legislation regarding how animals that are going to be slaughtered should be transported .
These measures include the time the animals spend on the road , how much room they have , and so on .
It seems that the sentence you provided is incomplete , as it only contains `` etc . '' which does not provide enough context or content to identify grammatical errors . Please provide a complete sentence for me to analyze and correct .
However , it is still perfectly legal for a group of people to chase a fox with a pack of dogs and watch as they chase the fox until it is exhausted and then get torn apart by the dogs .
This , apparently , is a sport .
The government has made it illegal for dogs to attack badgers , while it is still legal for dogs to attack foxes .
Surely , this is unfair and hypocritical of the government .
It is also illegal for two dogs to attack each other for the enjoyment of spectators .
Corrected sentence : At least if one dog fights another , the fight is , in some ways , fair .
But it is still perfectly legal for an infinite number of dogs to attack a single fox for the enjoyment of others . ( Note : The original sentence is grammatically correct . No corrections are needed . )
The fox stands no chance ; why is fox hunting legal while all other blood sports are banned ?
Fox hunting is , for the most part , enjoyed by the upper class .
It is expensive to partake in , as you need a horse , dogs , and riding equipment ( e.g .
Corrected sentence : helmet , boots , etc .
You also need land to do it on .
It is my opinion that the conservative government will not ban fox hunting because it will lose the support and funding from its upper-class , wealthy supporters who fox hunt .
In a time when Britain has very few surviving wild animals , surely something should be done to protect the fox .
The British government is always among the first to support the protection of wild animals in other countries ( e.g. , when banning whaling ) , and it is very ready to criticize countries that do kill wild animals ( e.g. , for the destruction of habitats in the Brazilian rainforests ) .
But when it comes to ceasing the hunting and brutal killing of one of Britain 's few natural animals , they seem to turn a blind eye .
According to people who partake in fox hunting , it is an enjoyable sport .
A sport is when two evenly matched teams or individuals participate in a game for enjoyment or a prize .
It could be grossly unfair to match one footballer against a team of eleven , as the result would be a foregone conclusion .
If one boxer had to fight ten boxers , this would be unfair .
Corrected sentence : However , matching one fox against a pack of dogs in a fight to the death is still considered a sport .
Cricket is a sport ; the brutal chase and killing of a fix for the enjoyment of the upper class is not .
Famous people , such as politicians , film stars , and other celebrities , are ordinary people , just like us .
People always idolize them and think that they are unusual , but they simply have extraordinary careers .
First of all , everybody deserves to have their private life without journalists , even though they live in the limelight .
They should be able to spend their time with children , families , and friends , etc. , to go on holidays and celebrate special occasions .
On the other hand , I think that it 's impossible for this kind of people to have private lives because fans and society want to know everything about them and their private lives .
They want to be in touch with their idols , to contact them , and to meet them in person .
To sum up , if we are famous people , we should bear in mind that fans will admire us , and journalists will come to us , take photos of us , and print them in gossip magazines or tabloids ( all that to meet the needs of the fans ) .
Stars should realize that they are at the center of attention .
In addition , they should choose what is more important to them : career or private life ?
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to apply for the summer camp job .
I 'm a 20-year-old student who loves taking care of children .
For me , this would be an incredible experience to improve my skills in helping the organization and cooking food .
I am a girl full of energy and always keep a smile on my face .
I think I am a great candidate for your job . If you need any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
The original sentence `` I look forward to hearing from you soon . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Best wishes , Andrea .
When the time arrived for Lucy to make the transition from being a teenager to an adult , all her self-assurance and determination vanished into thin air .
She had been a brilliant student in high school and intended to keep on being one .
She expected to work and study all at the same time .
She had big plans , but sometimes you have to slow down to achieve them .
She was going to study journalism and do a part-time job in the meantime .
And she went for it : she started her career working as a cashier in a market , but by the end of the month , reality hit her in the face .
She became exhausted , and her performance at university was deficient .
She needed to stop working or studying because her health was at risk ; she fell asleep in class , her diet was poor , and her temper was terrible .
She could only understand how disastrous her life was when she reached the limit .
Even though nobody pushed her to , she was taking on too many responsibilities that she was n't able to accomplish .
The original sentence is grammatically correct . However , if you 're looking for a slight rephrasing for clarity , it could be : '' Why are you running when you are just learning to walk ? '' This version replaces the contraction `` you 're '' with `` you are '' for a more formal tone , but the original sentence is already accurate .
Corrected sentence : One of her friends told her that once .
I want to make my future , and I do n't want to waste time , '' she retorted , but was she happy ?
Since then , she started to ask herself a lot of questions , and doubt became her faithful companion .
During the week of exams , she suffered her first panic attack .
That was the sign that it was definitely time for a change .
A friend of hers took her to a therapist , and after a few sessions , she began to catch a glimpse of what it was all about .
Corrected sentence : `` Success is not final ; failure is not fatal : it is the courage to continue that counts .
Corrected sentence : Her therapist said .
Corrected sentence : Finally , there was the clue .
She would have to work on that for all her life , though .
Her biggest challenge was learning to accept her limits , but she would soon understand that life is about growing every day , so she 'd have to enjoy the journey and give her best over and over again .
Hello there , my good folks at Dischan .
My name is Sigfried Jensen , and I would like to apply as a musician for your esteemed company .
I have no formal education to document my composing abilities , so I will let my compositions speak for themselves .
I can compose music of a standard and looping nature ; these can be in whichever style you require . On top of this , I can also edit and polish given audio samples to make them usable in various new scenarios .
In case your demand for music is n't high enough , I also possess secondary abilities in marketing , market communication , and general electronic expertise .
Moreover , I can also provide minor visual designs if needed .
My previous work experience is somewhat limited , consisting of a couple of years as a musician for a small media company called Dischan , as well as a short period as a TV and general electronics repair technician for various companies , including B & O .
Corrected sentence : How important is it for you to read books in English ?
Corrected sentence : In my opinion , it is important because it improves my vocabulary and helps me express ideas easily .
Could you tell me if you have any reading habits to learn English ?
I do n't have the reading habits to learn English ; in my opinion , it is a custom that I should have learned when I was a child because I would have grown with reading as a hobby rather than as a duty .
Do you think that it is difficult for you to create the habit of reading to learn English ?
I think it is difficult for me to create reading habits because I do n't like it , but I believe it is possible if I practice .
Most infant educators , psychologists , and education professionals believe that using storytelling in early childhood education is beneficial for children 's development .
Corrected sentence : But is it really that good ?
Corrected sentence : Does storytelling have any disadvantages ?
Using storytelling is a good way to work on values and emotions , as children are too young to express them by themselves .
They see themselves in the main character , and through his experiences , they can learn how to act in these situations .
For instance , if the story is about fear ( an emotion that makes them feel insecure ) and ends in a good way , they will have different methods to overcome their fear and feel more secure and self-confident .
Furthermore , they can take part in and build their own stories .
Their vocabulary will increase at the same time that they are working on their social skills .
In addition , they can see that every act has consequences for which they have to be responsible .
Corrected sentence : However , there are some points that need to be considered . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are necessary . )
Storytelling must be chosen according to the ages of the pupils .
One of the reasons storytelling may not work is that some teachers expect more than their pupils can do .
Moreover , if the story is too long or dull , they will lose concentration easily and cause their classmates to lose it as well .
To sum up , we must take advantage of storytelling to consolidate concepts , values , and emotions , and let our imagination flow .
I live in one of the biggest cities in the country .
Corrected sentence : People who live in our city generally face transportation issues .
Instead of long-term solutions , local authorities are focused on short-term solutions .
The quality of public transportation vehicles can be improved .
The new form of public transportation must be supported by the government .
People should be convinced to use public transportation .
The human brain is the most powerful computer known to man , yet it is small and light .
Corrected sentence : It is the control center of the body ; it can instruct it to move freely around its surroundings and interact with other humans and objects .
The brain can make decisions ; it can communicate .
The only function of the brain that computers can rival is memory .
Some of the human brain 's functions have been taken over by computers , such as accountancy , with the invention of electronic calculators .
In fact , the whole subject of mathematics has become easier with the invention of the electronic calculator .
Corrected sentence : But the subject has not changed ; electronics have only solved a few mathematical puzzles .
Most of the theories used today were hypothesized and proven before the invention of the calculator .
Corrected sentence : Computers , however , have almost unimaginable accuracy .
Most high-precision engineering projects undertaken today use computers and laser technology to make parts accurate to thousandths of a millimeter .
The computer is very widely used in the modern world , but in almost every case , it is only an aid to the brain .
The human still has to tell the computer what to do . ( Corrected sentence : The sentence is already grammatically accurate and clear , so no corrections are needed . )
The humans are still in charge .
The human brain is in no way made redundant by the invention of the computer , and I think that it will be a long time before the technology is discovered to make an electronic machine that can compete with the brain in achieving even one of its functions , let alone all that the human brain is capable of doing .
Corrected sentence : Hello , Tara .
You are starting an amazing project for your life . Corrected sentence : You are starting an amazing project for your life . ( Note : The original sentence is grammatically correct , but if the intention is to convey that the project will significantly impact your life , a more precise version could be : `` You are starting an amazing project that will change your life . '' )
I know it is really difficult to start , but then it becomes easier .
You can start asking your teacher and your schoolmates if they want to be a part of that .
They will probably say `` yes .
Corrected sentence : Together , you can decide what to do .
At my school , I made that , and it resulted in something .
We started by creating rules to respect the environment . I do n't want to share more ideas because it is important to be original .
Corrected sentence : Good luck !
It seems that the sentence provided is incomplete , as it only contains the name `` João . '' Please provide a complete sentence that includes grammatical errors , and I will be happy to help you identify and correct them .
If the rate of car ownership continues to increase at such a rapid pace , then the roads will be completely congested .
This is the main problem facing the UK 's transportation system .
The reasons for this are numerous and varied .
People today want more freedom and have more disposable income , both of which will lead to an increase in car ownership .
Many people also feel unsafe walking or using public transport to get to places , and mothers who would have walked to school when they were young insist on ferrying their children to school by car , as they believe , whether correctly or not , that there are too many child abductors around for it to be safe for children on the streets .
These views are supported by cases like the James Bulger case and the Fred and Mary West case , which have received very high publicity and have increased public awareness among people on the streets today .
People also use cars because they are more convenient than public transport ; they can travel whenever they wish and can go `` door-to-door '' instead of having to walk to bus stops and stations .
The enormous levels of vehicles on the roads have meant that using a bicycle to travel has become unacceptable to many people due to the danger and the levels of pollution from cars on the streets .
Rail travel has seen a decrease in popularity in recent years due to the immense popularity of cars .
Some people may not use trains due to what seems to be unreliable services .
Trains also fail to offer the freedom of choice available with cars , as passengers are tied to the timetables and locations of railway stations .
I think that the government should help Britain 's transport by aiming to decrease the amount of car usage and increase the usage of buses , trains , and other forms of public transport .
The government should do this by investing more money in public transport than in road improvements , such as the widening of motorways .
This increased investment would lead to more attractive public transport , with more services on the timetables , lower rates , and fewer delays .
These factors may cause people to switch from using their cars to travel to work or school and instead use buses or trains .
This would lead to less congested roads , which could then be used efficiently by people with no other option , and a less polluted environment for all of us to live in .
This is because public transport is less polluting than personal car usage .
Scientists believe that it may not be safe to eat beef products . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
Several years ago , the disease BSE , or 'Mad Cow Disease , ' became quite commonplace among cattle .
The disease causes a mental deficiency , preventing the cow from thinking for itself , and it slowly dies .
This BSE has been known to cross animal barriers ; several sheep have had a similar disease after eating feed made from the remnants of dead , meat-stripped cows .
Now , scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and humans , as more and more cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ( CJD ) are appearing more frequently .
There is , as of yet , no cure for this disease , and the only way humans can contract it is by eating beef products .
This has clearly put a lot of people off beef , as the press also covered the government 's inefficient quality control , and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying .
The disease can take up to 15 to 20 years to become evident in humans , so even if people give up beef today , they will have a chance of getting CJD .
However , giving up the products now would reduce the chances of being crippled by this disease in the future .
If a lot of people gave up beef products , it would have effects on the agricultural industry .
Cattle farmers will be hit particularly hard if no one wants to buy their meat .
It will also affect other animals being sold for meat ; more people will want to buy meat from sheep and pigs , so they can still eat the same amount of meat .
The whole episode may send the price of beef down , so people will buy it and take the risk ( which must be tiny ) rather than fork out for more expensive meat products .
If no one wants to eat beef , then cows will only be bred for their milk , which means there will possibly be fewer cows in the future .
If cows are no longer required by the public for food , some abattoir workers may lose their jobs , and several butchers , to whom the money from beef products is a considerable percentage of their income , may be hit hard by this .
The politicians still say it is safe and that they will continue to eat beef .
However , many of these people are elderly , and by the time the disease has developed in them , it wo n't really be considered a premature death .
Corrected sentence : However , for us young people , is the risk too great ?
I have n't stopped eating it . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
I am a final year student in Linguistic Mediation at the University of Rome , and my mother tongue is Italian .
English , French , and German are the languages I am most confident in , but I also speak a little bit of Russian and Finnish .
My degree course is primarily focused on foreign languages and cultures , anthropology , and linguistics .
Corrected sentence : Presently , I am an Italian teacher for foreigners , but I 've also translated philosophy texts and curriculum vitae from Italian into English and vice versa .
There is no future for public transport in my country . Yes , it is a fact that it is overcrowded everywhere , besides the pollution caused by its huge numbers all over the city . Additionally , we can not forget the rising prices of petroleum products . Nowadays , traveling by car is more convenient , safer , and cheaper .

Seven '' can be categorized as a chase and police film based on the several crimes that occur during the movie ; people consider it a moving and gripping experience .
The main characters were portrayed by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt . One of the most highly regarded facts was that the film grossed more than 330 million euros in 1995 when it premiered .
It is directed by David Fincher , who has also been in charge of `` The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , '' and it is a Paramount production .
The film narrates a series of murders related to the seven deadly sins ( lust , pride , wrath , laziness , greed , gluttony ) committed by a psychopath who left a mark on each victim to indicate the sin for which they had been killed .
This led to the investigation by two policemen who tried to fit all the pieces of the crime together perfectly , but it is going to be more difficult than they expected .
I personally think that this film is fast-moving and spine-chilling . I found it astonishing ; I appreciate that there is no happy ending and that there are unpleasant scenes due to some murder scenes .
If you like mystery films , I strongly recommend them .
I sincerely hope this review convinces readers to watch the film .
Dear Joe ,
Corrected sentence : Thank you for your letter .
I 'm very glad that you have thought about visiting my country .
I 'm sure you will like it . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
I can give you some tips for traveling , depending on what you like to do .
If you like museums , galleries , and architecture , I would recommend visiting our beautiful cities , such as Wroclaw , Krakow , Poznan , Gdansk , and of course , our capital , Warsaw .
On the other hand , if you prefer nature and physical activity , you should consider going to our mountains—the Sudetes or the Carpathians—or to the Mazury region , which is full of lakes .
You may combine it too .
For example , you may fly to Warsaw , visit the city , and then take a trip to the north , including our sea—which , unfortunately , is n't the warmest and prettiest sea in the world .
Corrected sentence : Honestly , you can skip it without hesitation .
Corrected sentence : Our lakes are truly worth visiting .
Corrected sentence : There are many possibilities there to spend your free time .
You can go horse riding , swimming , kite surfing , fishing , etc .
Next , we could meet in Wrocław .
I would show you the city that I like very much .
Corrected sentence : Then , I will take you to the mountains .
You may finish your trip in Krakow and then look for a job there or in Warsaw .
Corrected sentence : There are our two biggest cities , which have many students and many job offers available .
As you speak very little Polish , it will also be the easiest way to find appropriate work for you with an English-speaking company or something similar .
I believe Poland is a very good place for you to be .
The landscape is beautiful , and the people are very friendly .
The original sentence `` Let me know if you need any more help . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : Let me know if you need any more help .

The 20th Century invention that has had one of the most radical effects on people 's lives is the television .
During the 1950s , America witnessed the beginnings of a cultural revolution .
The era of Populuxe instigated a 'must-have ' ideology in the nation , and the most important 'must-have ' was , of course , the television .
The presence of television has brought about several crucial trends in our culture : the mass culturization of various groups , the commercialization of our lifestyles , and the rapidity and breadth of the information that reaches us .
Corrected sentence : Gathered around the television , the American family learned about the 'ideal ' way of life .
But the picture of perfection was the same in every home . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
We all received the same information . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
We all saw the same families , the Cleavers and the Andersons , etc. , telling us how we should behave .
Mother was always beautiful , Father knew best , and the children had cute , silly , harmless problems .
As a result of this omniscient picture , a farmer in Iowa had an idea of what a family in New York consisted of . Corrected sentence : As a result of this omniscient picture , a farmer in Iowa had an idea of what a family in New York was like .
Corrected sentence : People in New York watched Green Acres .
Corrected sentence : Today , the same trend continues .
To white people , ghetto life is slightly less of a mystery .
The examples on television are blown up and exaggerated , but people get a general idea of different lifestyles .
Rather than several small , isolated cultures , the United States is moving towards mass culturalization .
Corrected sentence : The presence of another 's reality in our homes is a major part of the reason .
Another effect of television on people 's lives is the commercialization of our lives .
Advertisements , which originally served only to inform people of their purchasing options , have developed into an art form . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
15-second blocks of our time are sold for millions of dollars , and as a result , the American population is made to laugh , cry , and often to buy a product .
Finally , and perhaps most importantly , the citizens of America have experienced a great increase in the amount of information they receive with the advent of television , as well as in the time it takes for that information to reach them .
A hundred years ago , different sections of the country ( and the world ) were isolated and separated by the time it took to mail a letter and print a newspaper story .
Today , we know within seconds , or in the case of the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion , we know live—immediately .
This abundance of information has led to a drastic alteration in people 's ability to react to major events .
Our view of the world is different ; it 's closer and in our living rooms .
A good example of this is the reaction to the Vietnam War .
The war was , indeed , unpopular with or without television .
But the reality of what we saw—the casualty counts , the bloody children under the American flag—did much to enhance the negative aspects of war .
Overall , the television has caused a radical change in our lives .
We are open to manipulation as well as to stimulation .
The television is a powerful and dangerous tool .
It can greatly enhance and improve our lives , but it is most important to be aware that it is a manipulator .
We must be mindful of what we watch .
I do n't agree with the statement that says there is no future for public transport because traveling by car is so much more convenient .
When you decide to travel by car , you feel independent ; you can stop whenever you need , set off when you are ready , and that is why traveling by car is said to be convenient .
However , there are sometimes more important things than feeling comfortable when traveling , such as money . Traveling by car is expensive , as the price of petrol is still increasing due to limited natural resources .
Although there are some places in the entire world where car users can not complain about the price of petrol , there are also many more areas where people exchange driving cars for commuting or riding a bike , as they ca n't afford to own a car .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , we are much more aware of the environment .
Thus , we know that using cars is harmful to the environment . We are advised to take public transportation instead of traveling alone , as it produces fewer exhaust fumes per passenger .
What is more , in multiple countries there is a festival of public transport , during which people celebrate by traveling for free on public transport and are asked to leave their private cars in the garage .
To sum up , in my opinion , public transport will remain as long as scientists do not discover new natural resources of petrol or invent a cheap equivalent to charge cars .
We do not care about the larger environment in China ; we only care about the environment in or around our own house .
We throw all kinds of housing waste into the same basket , and the cleaner will collect it .
Corrected sentence : Sometimes there will be an odor remaining , as the basket is indoors .
We do not care about the air , even though air pollution is very serious in some parts of China .
We only choose the way that is convenient , but it may have a negative effect on our living environment .
Dear Jo ,
Spain has many beautiful places that you ought to see .
I think you should start off in Madrid , so we can meet ; I 'll show you around .
We 'll go to all the tourist places , and you 'll get to try a lot of delicious food .
Then you should visit Barcelona ; it 's a truly beautiful city with many must-see places , like the Sagrada Familia . You 'll also be able to go to the beach to relax .
From there on , I think you could follow the coast and visit cities such as Valencia , Cartagena , or Málaga during the summer , leaving the inland cities for autumn .
As for working here , well , it 's not going to be easy ; we 're having difficulties regarding that . However , I guess you could find a part-time job at a restaurant or something . I could help you with sending your CV and all that .
Corrected sentence : And if everything fails , we can always ask my aunt ; she owns a small shop in the city centre , and she 'd be more than happy to have someone helping her out .
Corrected sentence : See you soon !
It seems that the sentence provided is incomplete , as it only contains the name `` Sam . '' Please provide a complete sentence that contains grammatical errors , and I will be happy to help you identify and correct them .
Hi Jo ,
In my country , there are a lot of opportunities to work and have fun .
Italy is an enormous country full of culture and opportunities .
Corrected sentence : For example , I live in Jesolo , near Venice , and there are business companies , other hotels , and firms here . If you want , you can also take a guided tour .
Corrected sentence : In my view , the best thing to do is to start traveling from the bottom of Italy and visit all the amazing cities in this country : Florence , Milan , Genoa , Rome , and Venice .
There are also a lot of courses and other activities to do .
You also have a lot of opportunities with universities .
Venice and Padova are the most important cities for learning .
Corrected sentence : It is a great idea .
I hope I can see you soon , and I hope to be helpful for your decision .
As you may already notice , Warsaw is a beautiful and big city .
It was really hard to choose one place that you just must visit .
Corrected sentence : Obviously , it largely depends on your interests .
If you want to know Warsaw from a historical perspective , I recommend visiting the Old Town .
The Royal Castle . ( Note : The original sentence `` The Royal Castle . '' is already grammatically correct as it is a proper noun referring to a specific place . No corrections are needed . )
It would be helpful for you if you asked for a guide .
Honestly , I think it is very educational but a bit boring .
I am sure that , as young students , you will definitely appreciate something less educational but more interesting .
Your must-visit place is the National Stadium .
I have been there many times , and trust me—there is a lot to see .
It was built specifically for EURO 2012 .
We were the host country , so we had to make as much effort as we could .
The first thing that attracts our attention is the interesting architecture .
It looks like a red and white basket , which refers to Poland 's flag .
The stadium is also equipped with a heated pitch , a training pitch , façade lighting , and underground parking .
There is even a railway station situated opposite , which was built in the same style as the stadium .
When you get there , you will not be disappointed .
There are trips with a guide where you will hear the story of the Stadium , which , in my opinion , is very interesting .
You will also visit changing rooms where football players prepare for matches .
It is a multipurpose venue that is able to host not only sporting events but also concerts , cultural events , and conferences .
I highly recommend visiting this place .
It would be an unforgettable and fascinating trip .
It would also be a great windfall for all football lovers . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
You will not regret it ; I promise .
Life changes could be possible in the coming years because a new way of life is emerging due to technological advantages .
When I look back , I realize that teenagers are different ; they are looking for different things in their lives .
For example , when I was young , all students used to study for several years to become experts and get good jobs .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , teenagers study only for a few years because they want to get a job quickly .
All around me , everything is changing quickly : education , ways of life , ways of thinking , and technology . I believe all of this will bring about changes in the lives of the future .
In fact , I am looking forward to seeing this change , and I hope it will be as good as I expect . Above all , I hope a significant change in the health service will be made .
With the economic development , a growing number of much-needed buildings are taking the place of areas of farmland , forest , and wetland .
As far as I am concerned , this phenomenon does more harm to citizens as well as animals than good .
Corrected sentence : First , the large-scale buildings bring various kinds of pollution .
The process of building produces a large amount of material rubbish as well as noise , which disturbs the lives of the inhabitants around .
On the same time , the glass covering the surface of the skyscraper reflects dazzling light.Corrected sentence : At the same time , the glass covering the surface of the skyscraper reflects dazzling light .
Besides , the destruction of the habitat hastens the extinction of wildlife and reduces the diversity of species .
Corrected sentence : With no more trees and grasses to freshen the air , air pollution will become more serious .
Corrected sentence : What 's more , building much more housing than needed is a waste of society 's resources .
To solve those problems , strategies should be implemented by the government .
First , measures should be taken to protect the areas of farmland , forest , and wetland .
Each city should be promised to have the least amount of necessary afforestation area .
Corrected sentence : What 's more , the government should encourage investment in environmentally friendly projects instead of housing construction .
The last point is that
The sentence `` Presents '' is incomplete and lacks context . To provide a corrected version , I would need more information about what you intend to convey . However , if you meant to say something like `` He presents '' or `` She presents , '' here are a couple of corrected examples:1 . `` He presents . '' 2 . `` She presents . `` If you have a specific context or additional information , please provide it for a more accurate correction !
In regard to a recent radio discussion about the positive and negative aspects of receiving presents such as luxuries , homemade items , or different life experiences , the decision is open to debate .
On the one hand , I strongly believe that people should receive presents at any time , whether it is for Christmas , birthdays , or just because you want to demonstrate to someone how much you care for them .
Live experiences are known for being the best type of present nowadays , as people have finally understood the importance of memories in our lives , instead of just collecting luxuries , clothes , or photographs .
Moreover , from my point of view , in addition to having the amazing opportunity to receive this type of gift , you are also able to share it with the people you love the most .
In addition , I do not actually find any disadvantages to this type of present .
On the other hand , homemade items are extremely pleasant to receive as well .
Not only are they made with true love , but they are also generally made with recycled products , such as glass , plastic , and even wood .
The main advantage is that , as mentioned before , the item was probably made with passion .
However , the person who receives the present may not like it at all . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Corrected sentence : That is the main disadvantage . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
These ideas had led me to my conclusion : the best present to receive is experiences , as you will always remember them and share them with your family and acquaintances .
My teaching philosophy changed considerably when I finished this course that was based on theories in second language acquisition .
Until now , my beliefs about teaching English focus on the following opinions : ( i ) children should be familiar with English as early as possible ; ( ii ) the teacher should motivate students so that they can achieve their learning goals ; ( iii ) the teacher must be a good monitor in class ; ( iv ) the teacher must interact well with students .
My beliefs help me feel more confident about becoming an English teacher in the future .
Corrected sentence : First of all , parents should allow their children to learn English early .
My first misunderstanding is that adults will acquire a second language better than children .
By reading about child language acquisition in SLA , I learned that the best period for people to acquire a second language is during childhood ( McLaugh , 1978a , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p. 123 ) .
Moreover , children between the ages of 5 and 9 , known as the critical period , can acquire a second language naturally without needing any special teaching methods .
Children have better phonology than adults , and they display morphological sensitivity that adults do not .
However , older learners will be successful in second language ( L2 ) syntax . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
Patkomski ( 1980 ) found that learners who learned L2 after the age of puberty received lower proficiency scores than those who started learning L2 before puberty .
Therefore , in the future , I will encourage everyone to let their children make an acquaintance with English as early as possible to help them have an accent like native speakers .
If I have a chance to teach children , I will create an active atmosphere with various activities that focus on communication skills and give students opportunities to be exposed to authentic input such as cartoons , music , and more .
Secondly , the teacher should inspire students ' motivation and raise students ' awareness in learning so that they can achieve their target goals in language learning . When I was in grade ten , I did not have the motivation to learn English because of my parents ' obligations .
Consequently , my results do not meet the goal that my parents expected .
Until I met a tutor invited by my parents , I passed the exam in class with high marks , and I had the motivation to learn better .
The original sentence `` I want to become an English teacher . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I want to become an English teacher .
Motivation is the second most important factor in SLA that helps students achieve success in learning L2 ( Skehan , 1989 , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p. 426 ) .
Students can use all their time to do what they are interested in , and they will never get bored .
The more motivated one is in language learning , the more successful students will become .
It is really a long-term project that allows students to improve their proficiency in a second language .
They need to observe a number of comprehensible inputs and complete many tasks to achieve their goal .
As a teacher , I will make efforts to increase the students ' frequency of motivation because of the changes over time , as noted by Dörnyei and Ottó ( 1998 ; detailed in Dörnyei , 2000 , 2001a , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p. 428 ) .
Corrected sentence : Thirdly , a good teacher is one who can organize all the activities in class well .
For instance , when I teach grammar , I have to define how many structures I can teach in a lesson that is enough , and with some difficult grammar rules , I need to break them down to teach in turn .
Corrected sentence : Learners need time to memorize the new rule and incorporate it into their learning system .
After teaching the rule , I will ask my students to work in pairs and communicate using the new structure based on my cue cards .
When they are working , I can hear their conversation and know not only what they say but also how they say it , so I can determine whether they have acquired the rules or are just using their learned knowledge .
Corrected sentence : Finally , interaction is also an interesting concept .
Gass ( 2003 ) found that `` language learning is stimulated by the communication of pressure , the relationship between communication and acquisition , and the mechanisms .
Therefore , I will teach my students only in English . I will give them more opportunities to communicate with one another through the tasks I assign in class . Then , I will move around the classroom and correct their mistakes through negotiation , recasts , or feedback .
When observing their dialogue , if they make mistakes , I will take note , and after they finish their practice , I will correct them .
I advise interrupting their speech because it is disrespectful to them .
In addition , if I always correct mistakes , my students will lose their confidence and they will not want to practice anymore .
This is my philosophy of foreign language teaching .
These beliefs help me examine what I am going to do in the future when I become an English teacher .
This course widens my knowledge a lot through the theories in the SLA book .
I think that students in the school of foreign language education must learn this course to have a better philosophy of teaching .
The aim of this report is to describe how my town takes care of the environment and what people do regarding this issue .
Corrected sentence : Firstly , I am going to talk about what my town does .
The town is generally clean , thanks to the cleaning services .
Every night , the roads are cleaned , and the rubbish is frequently collected during the day .
Even if the cleaning service is very efficient , people do n't usually take care of the environment .
They throw their wrappers on the ground .
In other words , citizens do n't completely worry about the places where they live .
The town has implemented a program to solve this problem by promoting prizes to those who take action against this bad behavior .
As a result of this new policy , the town is now more attractive and cleaner than it was in the past .
Residents have changed their bad habits , and the image of the town has improved .
In conclusion , thanks to the new way of living , tourists are more attracted and curious to visit , and the town has reduced its cleaning costs .
The amount of money saved is used to build new green spaces across the town .
European nations have , over time , been linked together both in war and in peace .
These countries have since been moving closer together along more institutional lines .
One such demonstration of this has been the formation of the European Community , made up of the European Coal and Steel Community , the European Atomic Energy Community , and the European Economic Community .
In 1987 , the European Community adopted the Single European Act , in which the member countries committed themselves to the realization of a single internal European market by 1992 .
This act has raised questions in Britain about whether it will result in a loss of sovereignty for the country .
The lifting of trade barriers between the member states will enable the free movement of goods .
This economic union will not create a loss of sovereignty for Britain , as it will merely aid in the exchange of goods throughout Europe .
However , the fear is that the act will lead to decisions being imposed on Britain since an important element of it is the commitment to majority rule rather than the previously common practice of consensus decision-making in the Council of Ministers .
This would result in the restriction of individual nations ' ability to veto key decisions .
British sovereignty could be in danger if this union leads to a European government imposing its authority on Britain .
A centralized European government would inhibit Britain 's decision-making ability .
The recent incident of the European Parliament imposing its ideals on Britain points out the authoritative principles that it may be forced to accept if such a strong central body is created .
It is believed that Britain ought to halt construction on the Channel Tunnel link due to environmental concerns ; however , this action seemed to be an imposition on Britain 's sovereignty , as an external body was trying to tell the country what to do .
If the European Community were to bring in a single currency , Britain might be deprived of its sovereignty since it would lose its individuality , but more importantly , it would forget its bargaining position on the foreign exchange .
Currency decisions would be made by a central body that Britain would have to accept .
If a single Europe were to lead to British troops fighting on behalf of Europe instead of their own nation , most sovereignty would be lost .
It would mean a supranational force fighting as a whole , with no real difference between its members ; it would not be a case of `` one force , one nation .
However , the state would still exist as an island , and people would always feel that they are British due to their roots and history .
Corrected sentence : Even if linked physically to Europe via the Channel Tunnel , Britain would still see itself as a separate country .
I personally believe that Britain will not lose its sovereignty if the union is based on an economic level of free trade among nations .
However , if a strong European government were created that made important decisions for Britain , such as currency settlements and the running of its foreign policy , this would mean that Britain would no longer be an individual state with the power to make its own decisions and would therefore lose its sovereignty .
The picture shows the process of making notes .
Corrected sentence : First , the most important progress is to design it in a way that avoids copying ; then it can be printed when this is finished .
Make sure the quality sheets are checked ; if they are bad sheets , they will be destroyed . If there are good quality sheets , they will be packaged and distributed .
The sheets conclude about cutting into separate bank notes , packing , and dispatching .
All of these are the basic processes . What we use is based on them .
Corrected sentence : The bank should make efforts to ensure security for the users . Through this process , we learn about banknotes ; they are an essential part of our lives , and we use them to buy whatever we need .
This graph shows data on the amount of petrol used in the United States and the United Kingdom .
As it is known , these countries are some of the most powerful regions around the world .
Firstly , the United States line expresses that the majority of the income percentage is spent by the poorest socioeconomic class .
Secondly , the amounts of money spent on cars are decreased by the richest drivers .
However , this patron is not the same as the other places .
In the first place , we can appreciate the percentage of capital used for gas that is provided by wealthy people who live in the United Kingdom .
In the second place , the lowest incomes are reported among British citizens who come from a poor socioeconomic background .
Once and for all , either the United States of America or the United Kingdom has a similar patron .
According to the richest drivers , both lines are connected in the same place .
Corrected sentence : Dear Summer Camp Holder :
Corrected sentence : Hello !
This is Mimi . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct , so no changes are needed . )
I am an outgoing girl who enjoys getting along with people very much .
A few years ago , I was an elementary school teacher , but I quit that nice job to pursue my dream of becoming a nurse . However , that would be an obstacle to getting along with these cute little angels .
Thus , I have a profound belief in myself to do this job well .
By the way , I once attended a summer camp during my college years .
A role that is the same as this job , such as preparing meals and snacks , organizing games and surprises , and taking good care of them , and so on .
Though it may seem that having to do so much will be extremely exhausting for me , both my experience and instinct tell me that it would be a great time with beautiful memories left in my life .
Either hard work or frustration could not change my decision ; only by trying the difficult can a person improve and find his way in life .
Corrected sentence : Above all , thank you for giving me the opportunity to show myself .
If I could be your partner , it would be my greatest pleasure .
Hope all of you enjoy a nice day . Corrected sentence : I hope all of you enjoy a nice day .
Corrected sentence : Your friend , Mimi , is here .
Dear Lionel Messi ,
I 'm writing to persuade you with some information that you probably do n't know about .
I would like to say that you should give more money to charity , and I think you should be paid much less than you are now .
Firstly , I would like to say that you should be paid much less than you are now .
Corrected sentence : Because you 're getting paid about £330,000 per week .
So , can you think about doctors and nurses ? They save lives almost every day , while you are just playing football and having some fun with your friends .
Therefore , you should be paid about £250 per game .
I think that is a huge amount of money , anyway .
In other words , I think you should give more money to charity because it needs your help .
So I would say that in the 1960s , the wage limit was about £4 to £7 per week .
It took about 20 years for that wage limit to double to £8-£14 per week in the 1980s .
When I was a kid , I was addicted to reading children 's stories .
In my teens , I used to read so many teen novels that my mother would reproach me for sitting too long reading instead of doing my schoolwork .
Luckily , I managed to do both , and I remember studying hard in order to get a real chance to read whatever I wanted with my mother 's consent .
Today , I realize how reading these stories has gotten me interested in writing .
I have always wondered how you start to recognize yourself as a writer and how you become an effective one .
Of course , a good writer must first be a good reader . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
This is how I developed my ambition to write .
Corrected sentence : Reading stories , poems , and novels has intrigued me to write my own .
Reading what my fellow writers here said about their experiences as writers—what pushed them to write , what made them go on , and how it made them feel—all of that provided answers to my questions .
More than that , I found insights into my own motives and goals as a writer .
I liked the close relationship between Shirley Carreira and her father and his library .
I enjoy being intimate with my book .
I love the feel and smell of them , and I prefer them to electronic versions all the time .
They make you feel as if you are in touch with the magic they offer .
Books draw you in as if by a spell . Corrected sentence : Books draw you in as if by a spell . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Michael is a very popular guy ; he is very intelligent , and he enjoys hearing the history about ghosts and strange things .
One day , his friend told him to go to a cabin because strange things were happening there ; he accepted immediately .
On Saturday , they were walking around the street looking for the cabin , and they met a very old cabin .
They saw a horrible ghost , and he asked them two questions about his life , but the guys said nothing . The ghost was furious . `` Okay , '' he said , `` the second question is : How many years do I have ?
Michael was nervous because he did not know anything about it .
The ghost said , `` Michael told me that if you want to save your family or your friend , you can only save one ; the other person will die .
Corrected sentence : After ten seconds , Michael said , `` I saved my family . '' He then apologized to his friend and ran far away . When Michael closed the door , he knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Although Louise felt nervous , she realized this was the opportunity of a lifetime .
Corrected sentence : That was the objective she had been dreaming of for many years .
If I make a decision , there will be no going back . I have to think it over .
The original sentence `` She was speaking to herself . '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : She was speaking to herself .
She could let her parents down . ( Note : The original sentence is grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Their expectation was to send her to one of the most prestigious medical universities .
Alas , she was not sure if they cared for her opinion .
Due to her humanist beliefs , science was not the field she was keen on .
Corrected sentence : Louise was given a chance to go abroad .
She did not mind working long hours at entertaining places or earning a little money .
Her spirit was crying to leave her country for the United States .
She could not say whether it was a judicious feeling .
Generally , Louise was said to be an indecisive person , which can be especially noticed in such cases .
The advantages of leaving outweigh the drawbacks .
Her parents did not seem to be over the moon .
The girl convinced them and made them realize that there was no `` end of the world '' if she chose her own way .
Everyone is afraid of something , but a lot of people are more afraid of catastrophic events than of things like cancer .
Even though people are scared of these things , they continue to smoke and drink alcohol .
Some of our fears are instinctive , so we automatically respond to danger before we have even had time to think about it .
Our fear makes us act instinctively ; we react so quickly , and we save ourselves .
This type of fear is a necessary and life-saving response .
There are different kinds of fear ; for example , phobias .
We experience phobias in situations that are not dangerous to our safety .
Many people have phobias , but they do n't threaten their lives every day .
Scientists say that phobias arise from negative experiences or traumas and that they are difficult to control , but that they could be prevented with the right therapy .
We know what fear is thanks to experience and culture .
We were born with small and basic fears , but we know that things like terrorism are dangerous . Stories on TV , the internet , and in newspapers increase the risk of extraordinary events and often influence our fears , leading us to worry about things that never happen to us .
To better enjoy our lives without being oppressed by our fears , we must be objective as we watch programs on TV and pay more attention to what happens around us .
Corrected sentence : INTERNATIONAL SPORTS MONTHLY : Swimming .
When I was younger , I used to swim , and it is my favorite sport now .
When I swim , I like the sensation of flowing through the water .
My advice is to enjoy the water !
Corrected sentence : Enjoy your time swimming ! ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
When you start to swim , you learn a lot of new techniques ; it 's like discovering a new world . I do n't swim to participate in a competition , but I swim to have fun .
The continuous development of computer technology has created a great deal of controversy in modern times .
There are widespread uses for computers in all parts of society nowadays .
One area that has drawn particular criticism is the computer games industry .
Since the early 1980s , when computers such as the Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 were introduced into the homes of millions of people , controversy has followed regarding their effect on children .
There is a widespread belief among parents that computer games hinder children 's ability to learn .
The development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers , such as the Amiga and PC , has served to deepen the problem .
The growing realism of the games appeals strongly to children .
However , parents feel that children should broaden their minds by reading books and that the computer games industry is encouraging children not to learn .
Computers have also been blamed for a fall in education standards among primary school children ; a belief accentuated by the results of surveys which state that the vast majority of primary school children are unable to do simple arithmetic in their minds and rely on another computer , the calculator , to help them .
Another moral dilemma that computers have created is their role in the workplace . Corrected sentence : Another moral dilemma created by computers is their role in the workplace .
There are many people who fear that computers will eventually replace humans in the workplace .
The role of computers is already significant in employment areas , such as accountancy , which requires a specialist ability to calculate and manipulate numbers .
These computers have replaced humans , and such changes have sparked fears that the level of unemployment could vastly increase as a result .
Corrected sentence : As computers are more efficient than humans , do not require payment for their work , are less temperamental than humans , and will never have a day off because they are ill , it seems mankind is faced with a great problem .
Another claim made that suggests the human brain could become useless is that computers promote antisocial behavior .
The creation of the World Wide Web and the Internet has created concern that the human race will become unsociable .
The Internet allows you to correspond with people all over the world , and it also contains many other functions that supposedly make life easier for us .
The Internet also has another fundamental problem , according to many .
The belief exists that the computer age and its developments , such as the Internet , will eliminate the challenges of life .
The human brain is constantly in need of being challenged to maintain itself ; however , with the introduction of the Internet , one can conduct their life without ever needing to leave the house , which many believe could menace society .
However , at the moment , the existence of computers is very much dependent on humans .
No matter how much artificial intelligence a computer may be able to demonstrate , it still has to rely on the human brain to program it and put it into operation .
Although there are plans to create computers that can program themselves ( which I personally feel is a very dangerous idea ) , the human brain still very much controls the computer and has the ability to end the existence of computers at any given moment ; thankfully , a power that computers do not have over humans .
Since I have been studying in Australia , I have realized that there is a significant difference in English study compared to China .
Corrected sentence : Traditionally , Chinese teachers would adopt cramming methods and pay attention to grammar and vocabulary .
However , in comparison , the English Academic Program ( EAP ) class encouraged independent learning and provided me with more opportunities to interact and converse with classmates .
After studying the EAP , I found that time management is my weakness .
Therefore , I will discuss study strategies by reading related resources .
The original sentence is grammatically correct . However , if you 're looking for a slightly refined version for clarity , you could say : '' Effective time management is a crucial factor in productive learning .
Corrected sentence : Firstly , as described by the Academic Skills Unit ( 2012 ) , time management can be achieved by creating a `` daily planner '' ( p. 23 ) .
So , I downloaded a daily planner and filled it with my study plans .
Corrected sentence : Doing this helps me complete my daily tasks more efficiently .
Secondly , the research of Mark ( 2006 , p. 25 ) also states that scattered time throughout the day should be utilized and made more productive .
For instance , I looked for chances to talk to native speakers while waiting for the train or participated actively in conversations during my breaks .
I have learned that small bits of time added together can be used very productively .
In conclusion , by researching and comparing study strategies , I discovered that time management is crucial for achieving productive learning .
Corrected sentence : However , to become better learners , it is also important for students to stay focused and motivated .
In my future studies , apart from spending my time more productively , I will also set manageable short-term goals and review my plans regularly based on my study targets .
Hello , my name is Xiawu Kam . I am nine years old this year . Today , I am going to write about my favorite sport . My favorite sport is basketball because playing basketball is fun and helps keep me fit !
I started playing basketball in grade one , and now I am in grade four . That means I have been learning for three years ! My dad likes to play basketball too !
You know ? I really enjoy this sport because it is very exciting !
If someone asks me which sport is the best , I will say that basketball is the best !
I really like basketball , and the teacher told me that I am really good at it , so I always play basketball when I have free time .
I am on my school 's basketball team , which includes the younger players .
I hope that this year I can join the older boys ' basketball school team !
I hope you can play sports like I do because it 's really healthy for everyone .
The original sentence `` Thank you ! '' is already grammatically correct and clear . There are no errors to correct . Corrected sentence : Thank you !
Corrected sentence : Thank you for reading my article . Thanks again , and goodbye !
Hi Mary ,
How about your life ? Mine has changed a lot since the last time we were in touch .
As I told you , new people have come to the office .
We have established a wonderful relationship , especially with one of them .
He is very outgoing and very friendly .
He has a fantastic sense of humor , and he always makes me laugh , so I can forget the bad moments .
He is very polite , generous , and honest .
At work , he is a creative person ; as you know , this is very important in our job . He always has an idea when the rest ca n't think of anything .
However , he can be a bit immature at times .
He is very keen on sports ; his favorite sport is basketball , like mine .
It 's a pleasure to be with him , and I really enjoy his company .
I think we have a lot in common ; we nearly have the same likes and dislikes .
He is a talkative person , but I am a bit shy , as you know .
Corrected sentence : However , I do n't think it will be a problem .
I must leave you now ; it 's time to work .
It seems that the provided sentence is simply the word `` Love , '' which does not contain any grammatical errors or context to correct . If you have a more complex sentence or a specific context in which `` Love '' is used , please provide that , and I would be happy to help with corrections !
Krashen 's theory is one of the most well-known and influential acquisition theories from the seventies .
Corrected sentence : Krashen presented this theory in several works over the years .
It was clustered in his great work , `` The Input Hypothesis : Issues and Implications '' ( 1985 ) , and it can be summarized in the following hypothesis :
Corrected sentence : The Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis .
Corrected sentence : The Monitor hypothesis .
Corrected sentence : The Natural Order Hypothesis .
Corrected sentence : The Input Hypothesis
The corrected sentence is : * * The Affective Filter Hypothesis . * *
The Acquisition-Learning hypothesis is perhaps the most fundamental of all the hypotheses to be presented here .
It states that adults have two distinct and independent ways of developing competence in a second language . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
On one hand , we have the acquisition , which according to Krashen , is the unconscious process that children undergo from birth to develop their ability in their first language .
Language acquirers are not usually aware of the fact that they are acquiring that language .
They are not aware of the rules ; they speak without thinking that what they are saying is correct , and they do not stop to consider the errors they commit because they do not believe they are doing it incorrectly .
Some things `` sound '' good , and others do not .
On the other hand , we have the learning process ; it implies the development of competence in the second language .
We use the term `` learning '' to refer to the conscious knowledge we have of a second language , being aware of the rules , for example .
Some theorists say that children acquire language , while adults can only learn it .
Corrected sentence : But according to Krashen , the acquisition-learning process suggests that adults can also acquire the ability to pick up languages , which does not disappear when we grow up .
But at the same time , it does not mean that adults can always achieve native language levels or that they have access to the same natural `` language acquisition device '' that children use ; it is so different .
Acquisition is a powerful process for adults .
Acquisition can not be converted into learning , and vice versa .
They are two different processes ; acquisition is the most important one because we have to control the mother language first and then the learning of additional languages .
An application for teaching , according to this theory , could be that the optimal way a language is learned is through natural communication .
As a second language teacher , the best thing is to create a situation where language is used in order to fulfill authentic purposes .
This will help students , children , or adults acquire the language instead of learning it .
Sport makes you test your limits . Corrected sentence : Sports make you test your limits .
You need to get ambitious to improve and convince .
For me , it 's simply passion .
It 's been forever since I loved basketball .
No matter whether I followed professionals on TV or watched the students on the basketball court at school , the fascination always caught me instantly .
When I was 7 years old , my father used to motivate me .
If I scored 10 times in a row from the same point , he would take me to the kiosk and let me choose as many sweets as I could eat .
Corrected sentence : Of course , I could n't make it .
The original sentence `` But I did n't give up . '' is grammatically correct . However , if you are looking for a more formal or complete version , you could say : '' However , I did not give up .
After many weeks , hours of training , and countless frustrating moments , my precision improved .
Corrected sentence : My father was stunned . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
He could n't believe that a young boy like me was able to score so many points .
The following day , I was rewarded with the promised sweets . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
Even 10 years later , my motivation has n't changed .
The corrected sentence is : `` The Scarlet Letter box is one of the most recognizable symbols of England .
Corrected sentence : There is no doubt that most young people want to be white-collar workers .
All my neighbors want to vote for the Green Party .
I saw an amazing crimson sunset yesterday .

First of all , this report is concerned with how to spend your shopping time in Albacete .
Albacete is easy to walk around in the city center , where you can come across most of the shops .
It seems that the sentence you provided is incomplete . If you could provide a full sentence with grammatical errors , I would be happy to help identify and correct those mistakes . Please share the complete sentence you 'd like me to work on !
In the commercial zone , you can find two small shopping centers .
Corrected sentence : All of them are on the main street , and one is in front of the other .
These two are not so big ; however , there are two or three small shops that are really original .
In contrast , I would mention two big shopping centers in my city .
Corrected sentence : All of them are on the outskirts , and there are :
Eroski is a place where you can find a lot of different shops .
Most of them are present in the city center too .
El Corte Inglés is a place where you can buy a lot of different brands across its 5 floors .
It seems that the provided sentence is simply the word `` Conclusion , '' which does not contain any grammatical errors or context to correct . If you meant to provide a longer sentence or a specific statement that needs correction , please share that , and I would be happy to help !
From my point of view , the city center is more attractive than the shopping centers .
It is a little bit stressful for me ; in contrast , I prefer a relaxing walk looking at shop windows rather than indoor shopping centers .
Corrected sentence : But it depends on how much of a shopping addict you are .
Hi , Dan .
Corrected sentence : Thank you for your letter . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Corrected sentence : How are things going ?
The original sentence `` I am fine . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I am fine .
Corrected sentence : Would you mind going with me this Saturday ?
This Saturday is the birthday of Mum .
Yesterday I bought her a new television , although she has an old one , but it is horrible .
This evening , I am inviting her to the cinema .
We are watching Spiderman , and after that , we are going to Burger King because she likes it ; however , I do n't like it , but there 's no accounting for taste .
Transport is an important activity in every country .
The advent of technology has been bringing about drastic changes in means of transportation over time .
At the same time , transport has become a very important means of development for any nation , as all nations are moving towards globalization .
Public transportation has been playing a very important role in transporting people from one place to another .
The bulk production and marketing of cars have been reducing the role of public transportation .
Corrected sentence : Cars have become accessible to everyone .
The people have preferred cars to public transportation .
This trend is very dangerous for the world .
This would increase air pollution .
Burning fossil fuels would increase , and this would lead to higher air pollution .
Public transportation should be more attractive and cost-effective .
Governments should encourage people to use public transportation . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
People should come forward to prefer public transport over their own vehicles .
The main problem in the United Kingdom is BSE , or as it is so-called , `` Mad Cow Disease .
It has been discovered that the disease can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of infected beef .
Beef production is a fairly large business in the U.K. , and it is necessary to discover more about this relatively new disease .
It was discovered that British farmers were to blame due to their various industrial techniques .
The disease was originally carried by chickens .
When the farmers killed the chickens for their meat , the remains ( bones and organs ) were processed to provide a cheap feeding product .
Unfortunately , the disease-carrying organs were not just fed back to chickens but also to cows .
The cows contracted the disease in a slightly different form , and this was when `` BSE '' first emerged .
The correct thing to do would have been to destroy the infected cows , bringing an end to a potentially life-threatening situation .
However , the farmers had money invested and did not .
When the infected cows were slaughtered for beef , their remains were processed and fed back to other cattle , spreading the disease further .
Corrected sentence : Unfortunately , unlike chickens , cattle were able to pass this disease on to humans through their beef .
The same industrial techniques are still used today , and with the people in the UK becoming aware of the facts and becoming more health conscious , the sales of beef have decreased .
It is impossible to learn that you have contracted the disease for as long as seven years .
Corrected sentence : `` Some attitudes of the public are : 'Why should I stop eating beef if I could already have BSE ? '
Another public attitude is to ignore warnings because there have not been any victims .
But it seems that the most popular option is to play it safe and quit beef entirely .
It seems that more and more families have opted for chicken , pork , or lamb as alternatives .
It could have devastating effects on the agricultural industry as well . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
If there is a point where supply outweighs demand , farmers will produce less beef and earn less money .
It is therefore conceivable to think that farmers will change from beef to an alternative product .
The doorbell rang while I was at home thinking about my lost little cat .
If you knew my pet cat , you would n't be surprised by my love for him .
His name was Timoshka , and he was n't as ordinary as other cats .
He was very intelligent and could understand my words clearly .
He always knew my voice and my moods .
If I remember correctly , I found him sitting next to my house in the street .
He was so dirty that I could n't see him in the dark .
His green eyes were shining there only .
I felt pity for him and took him into my home .
After having a bath , he changed into the white kitten that looked like a snowball .
Corrected sentence : Well , I came to my door and opened it . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
There was a little girl who lived near me .
She was holding something small and dirty .
Corrected sentence : To my great surprise , this something was a cat !
This cat is mine !
Corrected sentence : How happy I am !
The topic of environmental conservation and pollution prevention is very important not only in my city but also throughout the entire country .
Many people are concerned about the increase in productive waste , garbage on the streets , and the lack of effective processing .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , we still use traditional ways of recycling and rubbish gathering .
One crucial point is that we do not have a sorting system by type of rubbish .
We collect our waste in one bag and then throw it into the special containers that are placed in each city area .
Corrected sentence : From time to time , approximately twice a week , this rubbish is unloaded into vehicles and taken away to a recycling site .
It is difficult to imagine the further processing of it , but we know that plastic and rubber waste is recycled .
Regarding other items , I think they could be placed in containers and buried underground for conservation .
But there are a few steps in this direction from our officials : a new recycling factory was built in the suburbs and started functioning last year .
But on the other hand , many citizens complain about the shortage of garbage baskets and containers on the streets of our city .
Sometimes we may see pictures of someone throwing litter directly onto an embankment or a sidewalk in the center of the city , polluting the streets .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
Right after she got to work , where she was nothing more than a typical underestimated office worker , Anna was informed that she ought to go see her boss and prepare to be eaten alive because of the last report .
Once she set foot in his office , she was surprised by a crowd of people yelling , `` Happy birthday !
Corrected sentence : Literally everybody was there , even her husband Adam , who was holding their disabled daughter in his arms .
I 've got a real stunner for you , Anna , '' said her boss , smiling like a Cheshire cat .
Due to my upcoming retirement , I have been asked to find my replacement .
Corrected sentence : I told the management that you are the perfect choice .
Anna was thrilled to bits ; after all these years , she was going to become a manager !
Corrected sentence : Yet another surprise was about to happen .
Her skirt was being pulled , out of the blue—Anna looked down and noticed her 5-year-old daughter standing still on her disabled legs .
The original sentence `` It was truly astonishing ! '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : It was truly astonishing !
She fell to her knees with tears of joy running down her cheeks .
Corrected sentence : She felt as if she were on cloud nine .
Suddenly , her whole body started to shake .
Adam was standing at the hospital bed , staring at his wife 's convulsing body .
After many years in a deep coma , Anna 's family finally lost hope and chose euthanasia with aching hearts .
The teenage daughter silently shrieked and buried her head in Adam 's chest . Corrected sentence : The teenage daughter silently shrieked and buried her head in Adam 's chest . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Shaking stopped , and the long , monotonous sound confirmed that Anna had just left this world for a better place .
Now she could constantly celebrate her birthday with her beloved family .
I must say that I strongly agree that shopping is not always an enjoyable experience .
To begin with , standing in a queue can give you a terrible headache .
Only ten minutes are just enough in the atmosphere of people shouting and haggling over every last penny .
Every once in a while , when you get home after shopping , it can turn out that you have just bought a real pig in a poke .
The food might not be properly fresh , especially when it comes to dairy and meat products .
Not only can people not afford to buy expensive products , but they also spend too much money on useless goods .
It appears that the shop 's policy is very relevant to this particular matter .
It 's common to put products on special offer and hire some good-looking salespeople , so it 's almost impossible to refuse them .
Corrected sentence : As they say , you can shop until you drop !
On the other hand , it is not necessary to purchase anything at all .
People are shopping around these days repeatedly in order to compare various prices , are n't they ?
It 's funny , but they always seem to be in search of the biggest bargain of their lives .
There is no doubt that browsing at the mall without buying can be as tiring as breaking the bank .
Corrected sentence : Introduction to a paper
Corrected sentence : The supply chain involves the management and provision of information across many areas of a company ; it encompasses the selection of raw materials , the processing of those raw materials into finished goods , and the transportation of those finished goods or products to the end customers .
The main parts are the suppliers , production , and distribution .
One important task is to provide information in each area in order to create a logical connection between the main parts to achieve the objective of selling a good quality product while reducing costs and time .
The definition of a standardized process is the establishment of the same method to be applied in the production of certain activities or functions .
This method is already accepted with the required parameters .
A standardized product is the result of a standardized process . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
For example , the production of a Coca-Cola bottle in Brazil has to be the same as the production of a Coca-Cola bottle in Australia .
A standardized product must not have significant deviations in order to sell the same product to all customers .
Transport essentially constitutes our movement . Corrected sentence : Transport essentially involves our movement .
Cars ca n't always be affordable for all sections of society .
Public transport should be optimally run in accordance with the demand .
Public spending should be allocated appropriately to ensure the maximum benefit to the public .
Drive down any street in urban America , and you will see young men and women , both Black and White , driving Pathfinders , BMWs , Mercedes , and other luxury automobiles .
Corrected sentence : How do these young people acquire the funds to afford such expensive rides ? ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
They dress in Karl Kani , Pele Pele , and Guess clothing .
They wear Cartier wristwatches and expensive Nike shoes .
Corrected sentence : Where do the funds to purchase these fashions come from ?
In many cases , the answer is simple : crime .
As unfortunate as it may sound , many youths are well aware that crime pays , and it pays well .
What alternative does an inner-city youth have when faced with inescapable poverty ?
The answer becomes apparent when he or she is often surrounded by criminals living larger than those who are taking a more `` conservative '' path to financial security .
The philosophy is simple : if you want it , go get it—at any cost .
The consequences are few , especially when one considers the shockingly low percentage of criminals who actually end up in jail . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
The only danger that exists for a criminal comes from other criminals trying to take what 's theirs .
Police are no threat as they are far outnumbered ; it is virtually a game of chance as to whether one gets caught in the act of crime .
Fortunately for the criminals , these odds are drastically in their favor . The public calls for more police but refuses to pay the taxes needed to hire them .
The few police officers on the street are thus often left chasing criminals like a dog chases its tail .
If a criminal is apprehended and , under odd circumstances , is placed in jail for a non-violent crime , it is only a matter of time ( often a short amount of time ) before he or she is free to return to the wealth and comfortable living supported by burglary , mugging , dealing , or simple con games .
Jail space is reserved first for murderers and rapists ( as it should be ) , and when a murderer is convicted and sentenced , a dealer is put back on the street .
What an ordinary citizen imagines when they witness or hear about a non-violent crime is a thug bent on destroying society : killing babies , smoking as much weed as they can get their hands on , etc .
In reality , these criminals are merely working a job that pays them better than any other .
Corrected sentence : Why work at McDonald 's , where you are forced to work in a hot , cramped atmosphere , possibly with an overbearing boss who is stuck in a service job with no end in sight , making $ 5.00 an hour and shopping at K-Mart for clothes ?
It is obvious that crime does not pay .
The proof exists on any street in urban America : underprivileged youth rolling in luxury automobiles and rolling wads of money into their designer jeans . Corrected sentence : The proof exists on any street in urban America : underprivileged youth rolling in luxury automobiles and stuffing wads of money into their designer jeans .
This is more of an act of taking advantage of an opportunity than it is a choice .
There are few alternatives for low-income youths and fewer obstacles in the quest for cash .
With violent crime rising and financial support for more police falling , crime will continue to increase .
If you are looking for a film about teenage first love to watch on a rainy day , I recommend watching Endless Love .
This is a remake of the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film , but instead of an age difference , there is a class difference .
Directed by Shana Feste , the film shows the throes of teenage first love , when David , the smart , decent , blue-collar guy who 's happy to go into business with his father as a mechanic , falls in love with Jade , a wealthy , sheltered , and studious girl with plans to attend Brown University .
The class difference between their families becomes a significant issue for both .
The film features Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde in the lead roles .
With his handsome face and gentlemanly attitude , and her perfect silhouette , both try to live together with their different lifestyles .
They will fight against everything to protect their innocent love .
Both actors played their parts perfectly , but there were brilliant performances from the rest of the cast as well .
Another thing about this movie that you will love is the cinematographic effects .
The romantic scenes and the music produce a perfect atmosphere for this type of film .
Finally , the script is wonderful , lovely , and touching , just as David and Jade should be .
If you enjoy cheesy love movies , I definitely recommend that you watch Endless Love .
It is undeniable that housing and transport networks are very important for us ; however , plenty of people choose to build these in areas of farmland , forest , and wetland , which destroy the animals ' living areas and pollute the environment we live in .
In my opinion , it is time for governments to take action .
To begin with , the energy in the world is limited ; in other words , what we eat and what we need depend on farming and forests . If we run out of resources , building more large-scale buildings will ultimately lead to a disaster .
As for the animals , due to large-scale building projects , they can not live in the forest and have to move to other places . According to the China Daily , it was published that three elephants came into town and ate the crops . This is because their habitat was converted into roads . Many kinds of animals have to change their living habits , adapting to what people have done .
For the sea species , many visiting boats are put into the sea , polluting the ocean and leading to a high death rate .
To solve these intractable problems , the governments need to take measures .
For example , education is the key to raising people 's responsibility ; the government can teach through public media . It can also allow organizations to go around the world and spread the problems that the areas have destroyed . These are perhaps long-term solutions , but they are more realistic solutions than setting up yet another international organization .
One of the greatest inventions of all time is the television .
The invention that swept the world and changed leisure habits for countless millions was pioneered by Scottish-born electrical engineer John Logie Baird .
It had been realized for some time that light could be converted into electrical impulses , making it possible to transmit these impulses over a distance and then reconvert them into light .
And now it has become one of the most important mass media .
Millions of people all over the world enjoy watching TV in their spare time .
It informs , educates , and entertains them .
It influences the way people look at the world and makes them change their views .
TV simply helps us relax after a hard day 's work by providing a great variety of entertaining and musical programs .
Corrected sentence : But there are some opinions that television does a lot of harm .
People are beginning to forget how to occupy their free time .
It prevents them from communicating with each other , visiting friends , or visiting relatives .
Corrected sentence : Indeed , people used to have hobbies ; they would go outside for entertainment at theaters , cinemas , and sporting events .
They used to read books and listen to music . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Corrected sentence : Now all free time is spent watching television .
Corrected sentence : Still , it 's not good for children to be glued to the TV screen all day long .
It 's very harmful to their health and to developing personalities because children prefer low-standard hits , horror films , or banal series .
I 'm not a very passionate TV viewer .
In fact , I only watch those programs that I find interesting and helpful .
I relax when I watch musical shows , humorous programs , and game shows .
To my mind , all these things depend on the lifestyle of people .
Nevertheless , television has obviously changed society , and it is probably used more than any other type of mass media .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
Corrected sentence : USA Summer Camps
I am writing with regard to your recent advertisement about USA Summer Camps .
I am interested in applying to work for you .
I am 22 years old and have a first degree in education from the University of Warmia and Mazury .

As a teacher , I have a lot of experience in organizing sports activities , as I have been a teacher and have done very similar things .
I am very knowledgeable about children and what they like to do in their free time . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
I am confident that I would be able to help these children spend their time very actively .
However , I am good at cooking as well . I would be able to help you with cooking if you need any help .
I am very knowledgeable about health food , which I prepare very often at home on my own .
I would be more than happy if you chose me for this job , as I am certain I could make a valuable contribution to your Summer Camps .
The original sentence `` I look forward to hearing from you . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I look forward to hearing from you .
Corrected sentence : Yours faithfully ,
The sentence `` Antonina Chludzinska '' does not contain any grammatical errors , as it appears to be a proper noun ( a name ) . Therefore , no correction is needed . Corrected sentence : Antonina Chludzinska
My name is Caro Gutierrez , and I 'm from Mexico . I am the type of person who likes being around children , helping them with their needs to make things easier for them .
On the other hand , I have the ability to manage different sports , such as swimming , basketball , volleyball , and softball .
The original sentence `` I like to work in a clean and organized kitchen . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I like to work in a clean and organized kitchen .
I also like to have all the required kitchen tools and the materials needed to prepare a meal handy .
I would enjoy working at this summer camp if you give me the opportunity , and I will be looking forward to hearing from you .
Corrected sentence : Dance your problems away .
Dancing has been my favorite sport since I was very young .
I learned from my parents how good it feels to move my body , and perhaps without them , I would n't be in a street dance crew right now while taking ballet lessons .
Does n't it just make everyone feel positively about dancing ?
Throughout history , dancing has developed into an easy task , and everyone can learn it .
Recent studies show that whenever you are downcast or having issues , this sport stimulates your senses and has a great impact on your body and nervous system .
Corrected sentence : Recent additions include a healthy lifestyle , which has an impact on your life .
It is a highly popular sport ; furthermore , it provides a lot of benefits .
Corrected sentence : Why not think about it ?
You 'll find that every time a fast song plays , you need to move even if you are sitting in a chair .
Instead of sitting down , you should take on the actual challenge and have fun . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . No corrections are needed . )
Dancing is not intended for a specific age group , so everyone can start it .
The only advice is to clear the negative mood from your head , forget about the setbacks , and just wind down .
As long as you enjoy yourself , you 'll do excellently .
In conclusion , if you want a different kind of experience , go out and try something new .
The family is the most valuable and priceless gift that anyone has ever had .
Having a family means having everything . Corrected sentence : Having a family means having everything . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . )
The strong and special bond we have with our family is unbreakable ; it is that one powerful and magical connection that lasts forever .
The original sentence is grammatically correct . However , if you are looking for a slightly refined version for clarity , it could be : '' Friends may come and go , but your family will always be there for you .
When you 're at your worst , friends leave ; they become strangers through the night , and the next day , they do n't even bother to say hello .
We will never know for sure how many of our friends are real and how many just fake a friendship , but there 's one thing we can be sure of : our family is our best friend .
Friends ca n't always be relied on ; they are willing to betray you and spread your darkest secrets around .
But you can count on your family 's full support whenever you need it . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
The family is where we grew up , where we were taught what love and kindness mean , the treasure that provided us with the warmth of a home .
We 'll never go and ask a stranger for help ; we 'll go and ask for our mother 's or grandmother 's wise advice because it is a thousand times more valuable .
I believe that the infinite love our family has for us is the most significant proof that we could never find a better best friend than our own family anywhere else throughout the world because , since the day of our birth , we have been lucky enough to be given the best ones : our irreplaceable family .
A lot of teenagers are jealous of famous people , assuming that their lives are amazing and full of entertainment , joy , and fun .
Corrected sentence : But what about the price they have to pay for their extravagant lifestyle ?
No doubt , young people are sure that celebrities enjoy a life that most of them can only dream about .
At the same time , they forget a very important thing .
Corrected sentence : Film and pop stars , politicians , and models are sometimes deprived of their privacy .
Corrected sentence : Moreover , hundreds of fans and paparazzi are hunting for them and sometimes abusing their private environment .
Being in public is the main part of their profession .
On the other hand , they have families of their own and close relatives , and they have the right to their personal pastimes .
In my opinion , famous people deserve admiration due to their abilities and talents , though we should not only adore them but also respect them as well .
Much has occurred in the 20th century that has changed the way people live .
The invention that comes to mind as the most influential is the computer .
This invention from the late 20th century has forever changed the way people live and work .
The first computers were expensive monsters that filled an entire room and could perform only a few calculations per second .
Corrected sentence : With advancements in technology and the move toward miniaturization , desktop PCs have evolved .
The original sentence is grammatically correct . However , if you are looking for a slightly refined version for clarity , it could be : Corrected sentence : These small , relatively inexpensive machines can perform all the functions of their predecessors and much more .
Every day , new and exciting improvements are made to enhance the performance of these tools .
The impact of computers on the world has been significant .
They have changed the way people do business and have radically altered the way data and information are dealt with .
In short , the productivity of people has increased tenfold .
As we move into the 21st century , this fact will become more important .
The amount of information that is available in the world will require the use of computers to organize and extract what is of interest .
The personal computer has played , and will continue to play , a major role in our lives .
The day is just around the corner when every human being in the developed world will have his or her own PC linked by a cellular modem to the databases of the world , other PCs , and small digital assistants that will replace the printed page .
We have only just begun to realize the impact of this 20th-century miracle .
We are limited only by our imaginations . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
The corrected sentence is : `` The future of this invention looks 'bright ' indeed .
The Cherepovets match factory `` FESKO '' is the leading company in the match industry .
It is the largest manufacturer of matches in the post-Soviet space and Europe .
The original sentence is grammatically correct and clear . However , if you are looking for a slightly refined version for improved clarity , it could be : '' At the same time , the company continues to grow by increasing production and strengthening its position in the market .
The first attempt to build the Cherepovetsk match factory was in 1948 , when construction of the factory on the banks of the Yagorba River began .
But a set of equipment for the matches ' production was not received .
The building was developed into a plywood pipe plant .
The match factory was built only in 1970 . Corrected sentence : The match factory was built in 1970 only .
It was planned to buy equipment for production in Sweden , but eventually the factory was equipped with domestic positional equipment .
Then the Cherepovetsk factory 's capacity was almost the worst in the industry .
Corrected sentence : The general reconstruction of the company began in 1981 .
Five `` Arenko '' automatic production lines were installed over three years , and by the end of the technology modernization , 70 % of the equipment had been replaced with brand-new ones .
Corrected sentence : And it was the beginning of the ascent into a leading position in the industry .
Since 2012 , `` FESKO '' has been carrying out a large-scale modernization that has cost more than 200 million rubles .
The original sentence `` Fitness . '' is a single word and does not contain any grammatical errors , but it lacks context and clarity . To provide a more complete and meaningful sentence , we could expand it . Corrected sentence : `` Fitness is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle .
I would like to write about fitness because it is a topic that is very interesting to me , especially since I live in a family where no one ever stops .
We usually go jogging ; it 's very healthy because the heart can improve if someone runs constantly at a low speed .
But I know that jogging is a sport that many people hate because it 's tiring , so luckily there are infinite sports , and each of us can choose the best one for ourselves .
I find aerobic exercise very useful because it is based on physical activity combined with music ; it 's very fun .
Unfortunately , most people do n't take physical exercise seriously because they are lazy . I believe that exercise should be an integral part of our lives .
Corrected sentence : Obviously , fitness also depends on diet . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . )
The healthier you eat , the fitter you become .
That 's a big piece of advice , but no one , including me , can give up sweets .
Corrected sentence : Normally , people go to the gym to feel and look better .
When you feel good about yourself , you enjoy life more , and you even have more protection against illness .
In fact , it is for this reason that I am extending the hours of physical education at school .
Sport helps not only the body but also the mind ; it helps to vent nervous energy and makes you feel free .
Do it for yourself ; in the beginning , it will be hard , but in the end , you 'll be satisfied .
During my time as a teacher , I organized many group activities .
An example that I would like to provide is from my induction year , when I had to select and organize a group of students to represent the school in a charity campaign .
When I was selecting the group , I had to take into account each student 's background and motivations in order to have a mixed and cooperative learning environment .
I used my good communication skills to explain what was necessary to accomplish the task and to deliver instructional materials .
I used plenty of positive reinforcement to encourage everyone to participate because they were a low-ability group with low levels of motivation and were not used to winning in any challenge .
Corrected sentence : While the students were producing artwork to sell in order to raise funds , I supervised and monitored their tasks , giving feedback on the completed ones and how they could improve .
The campaign was a success , and the group was awarded the prize for the most supportive students in the national context .
To begin with , obviously , everybody has a right to their own privacy .
There is no doubt that anyone wants to be stalked - it is uncomfortable and annoying .
Even a star wants to have a little piece of quiet from time to time .
Surely a journalist or a paparazzo can be wrong in making his or her judgments .
It does n't matter if someone is a celebrity or an ordinary human being ; I believe that misleading gossip can ruin anyone 's life .
On the other hand , sometimes big stars would n't be as famous if they were n't chased by some paparazzi .
As a matter of fact , it appears that some people want to be followed on purpose—to gain more fame , of course .
A bad reputation often seems to be the shortest way to bask in glory .
Also , journalists deserve to earn a living and create good stories for their editors , especially if they are exclusive to a significant event .
Finally , a lack of privacy is an unpleasant price to pay for staying in the limelight .
Famous people are forced to live with it , whether they like it or not .
I agree that celebrities should n't be constantly followed by journalists , but if they truly wanted their privacy to be respected , they would n't be involved in so many public scandals ; there are people who just love getting others ' attention .
The diagram exhibits the changes during the last ten years in the quantities of immigrants to Australia .
It separates into nine world regions .
The ones that show a significant decrease are Europe and Asia .
Moreover , India , East Asia , and America have only experienced a very small decrease .
However , the regions of Oceania and Africa have really increased .
Corrected sentence : Overall , the chart shows that there has been a decrease in immigration . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
Nowadays , there are a lot of famous people in our society who are facing a lack of privacy . In my opinion , they deserve to have as much privacy as possible .
They are ordinary people with the same needs as everyone else .
However , as they are famous , they receive a lot more attention from the media and fans than we could imagine .
The unstoppable vast amount of attention is usually a worse thing than good .
Corrected sentence : Everyone wishes to have as much privacy as possible .
It is unbearable for famous people to deal with journalists when they go shopping or anywhere else .
Can you imagine yourself going shopping and having a group of journalists take a picture of every step you make ?
I can guarantee that none of us would appreciate a lifestyle like that .
I can firmly say that famous people , like politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
Students finish school at the age of 16 .
They are very young , but I believe that young people should have the chance to go their own way .
In my opinion , it is a good experience for young people to leave school at the age of 16 because they ...
Corrected sentence : I have the chance to gain practical experience .
Corrected sentence : People tend to look on the dark side .
I think there are two good reasons for going to work at the age of 16 . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
It seems that the sentence you provided is incomplete , as it only contains the word `` Firstly , '' which typically introduces a list or a sequence of points . To provide a corrected version , I would need the complete sentence or context that follows `` Firstly . '' If you have a specific sentence in mind that starts with `` Firstly , '' please provide it , and I will be happy to help you correct any grammatical errors .
Corrected sentence : Because they are young and motivated , some students are glad to finish studying .
Secondly , it is very important to learn as much as you can when you are young .
On the other hand , they are not old enough to know what they want to do with their whole lives .
I think it is hard to get prepared for real life .
Corrected sentence : Teachers do their best . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
Corrected sentence : But is it enough ?
However , the system is working , and it would be hard to improve it .
Corrected sentence : Everybody has the opportunity to make his or her own decision .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , more and more people tend to lead a healthy lifestyle .
Everybody wants to be healthy and to visit their doctor only once a year for a health evaluation .
However , living a healthy lifestyle is not easy ; it requires following the next steps , such as eating a healthy diet , exercising regularly , and getting enough sleep at night .
The original sentence is grammatically correct . However , if you are looking for a slight rephrasing for clarity , it could be : Corrected sentence : Engaging in physical activity is one of the most important aspects of maintaining a healthy lifestyle .
Regular exercise not only keeps your body physically strong , but also reduces the likelihood of getting many health-related problems and increases tolerance to stressful situations .
It is a fact that physical exercise makes our skeletal-muscle system stronger .
Well-developed and strong vertebral muscles keep our body in the correct vertical position , so vertebral deformation will not develop and back pain will not occur .
Indeed , doing a special type of gym activity called `` cardio '' improves blood circulation in the internal organs and the heart .
Corrected sentence : Accordingly , the risk of cardiovascular diseases decreases .
Also , everybody knows that strong positive or negative emotions , due to certain hormonal reactions , have an impact on the heart 's functioning .
In a regular person , heart rate and blood pressure can increase dramatically and even cause a stroke or a heart attack .
In trained individuals , the intention of heart contractions and stroke volume will increase .
The heart rate will change slightly .
Thus , trained individuals have a better tolerance for stressful situations .
Food that we consume is the next issue of a healthy lifestyle .
A healthy diet consists of balanced , fresh , and unprocessed foods with the proper amount of calories .
Our daily food should include enough protein , carbohydrates , fats , minerals , and vitamins that are required for normal body functions .
For instance , a lack of protein causes muscle weakness ; a lack of vitamin A causes myopia and night blindness .
Corrected sentence : Also , if food is not fresh or not prepared properly , it can contain bacteria or parasites .
For example , spoiled milk products can lead to gastrointestinal tract dysfunctions , and improper thermal processing of seafood can cause leptospirosis .
Moreover , fast food should not be on the table .
Avoiding fast food products diminishes a risk factor for developing serious diseases , such as cancer .
French fries are only one example . Corrected sentence : French fries are just one example .
Fries are usually cooked in a large amount of oil that boils all day .
According to science , in addition , we have to limit the size of portions and consume only the amount of calories that corresponds to our individual needs .
In this way , we will never have problems with obesity .
Corrected sentence : Being healthy is fun !
You may think that being unhealthy is just being fat , but that 's not true .
Being unhealthy leads to multiple diseases , such as heart problems , breathing issues , and even depression .
Corrected sentence : Besides being very awful , staying healthy is a good way to feel good about yourself , find new interests , and make new friends .
Corrected sentence : Here are some suggestions for you who want to be healthy :
Instead of going to a fast food chain during your lunchtime , why do n't you try going to our cafeteria on campus , which has a wide variety of salads and soups that are not only healthy but also really tasty ?
Corrected sentence : Did you know that our athletics team is accepting registrations ?
This could be a great way to find new teammates who would help you develop some skills .
Do n't waste time ; run to get the last spots .
Right outside our campus , you can find a gym that offers a lot of activities , such as spinning , aerobics , or even swimming lessons .
Corrected sentence : Also , because you are studying at this college , they will give you a big discount !
Are you what is called a couch potato ? Get up from the couch , turn off the TV , and go to the park on campus .
There you can breathe some fresh air while you read a book , play frisbee , or defend your point of view with other students .
Traveling by car has become increasingly popular nowadays .
However , public transport will still survive .
First of all , public transport , such as buses and subways , is much cheaper and less resource-consuming than cars .
The public transport can provide an affordable option for those who can not afford to buy fancy cars .
It 's also more convenient to travel by public transport , such as airplanes , for long distances since traveling by car for long distances can be really exhausting and inconvenient .
Last but not least , public transport is more environmentally friendly than cars , which means public transport will play an even more important role as environmental problems become more severe .
If I could dream about an imaginary transport , the machine would be long , wide , and white .
I must be lying inside it to travel , and the most important thing is that I 'll fall completely asleep in a few seconds .
I will be awake again when I arrive at my destination : the Spanish Golden Century .
There , the dramaturge Lope de Vega will be waiting for me to show me how plays took place in that period of time when the theatre was the best entertainment and the buildings were grand .
Maybe I 'll act like I did in the past .
Corrected sentence : Now I am going to write a movie review .
The name of the film is `` Bangalore Days .
It is a film by Anjali Menon , who directed the film Ustaad Hotel earlier .
It is a tale of three childhood friends from Kerala . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Kuttan , Kunju ( Diviya ) , and Arjun .
They are typical small-town youths dreaming of the big city , Bangalore .
Kuttan himself narrates the story .
He starts with a punch line : when they are in Kerala , they do n't like it , but when they are out of Kerala , they miss it so much .
At the beginning of the story , Kuttan gets a job in Bangalore , while Divya completes her BBA from a local college .
She is planning to go to a bigger city for her MBA .
At that moment , an astrologer recommended that Divya marry soon .
Corrected sentence : So an arranged marriage happens .
Corrected sentence : Her husband 's name is Das . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
When he first met Divya , he told her that he had a serious relationship and he did n't think he was over it .
Corrected sentence : But it did not hinder the marriage .
From the first night of the marriage , Divya found that something was very wrong when Das took off all his wedding clothes and came out in a sleeping gown with a laptop , saying that he had some office work to do .
When they go to their apartment in Bangalore , Das said that the room remains locked with old stuff ; hence , they can use the other rooms .
Das keeps himself busy with office work all the time ; besides , he is showing an attitude that he has no time for others .
Though Divya and he are a married couple , he has never shown any interest in Divya .
At the beginning , Divya always tried to match with Das , but she could not .
So she is losing patience and developing a careless attitude .
Das never feels anything for Divya .
Corrected sentence : She keeps herself busy with her friends .
Meanwhile , Arjun came to the city . As he is a motorcycle expert , he found a racing club named Storm Riders and started working as a motor mechanic .
He can ride a motorbike exceptionally well ; therefore , he won a race with the club owner .
Later , the club owner banned him for one year .
Corrected sentence : However , the coach of the club keeps an eye on him .
Meanwhile , Arjun falls in love with an RJ named Sarah , who is disabled .
The relationship faces many challenges .
Sarah 's mother does n't approve of the relationship .
They want to go to Australia .
The relation between Divya and Das is getting worse .
At this time , after a quarrel , Divya opened the locked room and found that the room was a keepsake of Das 's past relationship .
Now Divya understands why their relationship is not working .
Then she discussed it with her two best friends , Arjun and Kutty .
This duo becomes very angry .
Later , Divya goes back to her parents ' home .
Her family blamed Das and his family and wanted a divorce .
Kuttan wants to marry a girl who is a traditional Keralite , respects Keralite culture , and is also beautiful .
At this point , Kuttan made an urgent air trip to visit his sick father .
At the plane , he met Meenakshi , the flight attendant .
When Kuttan saw Meenakshi , he thought he had found his dream girl .
Corrected sentence : Later , they met suddenly in a mall , and at that time , they exchanged their phone numbers .
The relationship began to grow .
Latter , he found that Meenakshi is not a traditional girl ; rather , she is a trickster .
The original sentence `` It broke his heart . '' is already grammatically correct . There are no errors to correct . Corrected sentence : It broke his heart .
Eventually , he found Indian traditionalism in a foreign girl .
One day when the yearly racing event comes , the coach tries to persuade Arjun to attend the race .
At this time , Arjun found out that Das was the racing legend of the club .
Corrected sentence : Everybody respects and loves him .
He gets to know the story of Das from others .
After a terrible accident , Das 's girlfriend died .
After that , no one sees them . Arjun shares the thing with his friends .
Divya immediately went back to Bangalore and started her MBA .
Now the dog and Divya are coming closer .
In the race , Arjun becomes a champion .
Corrected sentence : On the same day , Sarah is leaving for Australia .
After the race , he drove them to Sarah 's home to help her .
Thus , the story finished happily .
The original sentence `` I love playing tennis . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I love playing tennis .
I think it is one of the most complete sports in the world . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
I started playing tennis when I was 10 years old ; my father taught me first , and then I had one of the best teachers in the country .
I was a great player ; I won several tournaments , and I had a lot of fans .
My game was based on resistance ; I could play for hours . I had just one thing in my head : pass the ball no matter what .
My height was an important advantage ; I could reach all the balls from one corner to another .
When I talk with kids who want to start playing tennis , I always tell them that tennis is about constancy ; it 's not easy . You ca n't watch a game on TV and try to play just like them in a couple of days ; it does n't work that way .
You must train for at least two hours per day , eat the proper food , avoid alcohol , and get enough sleep .
If you can do that , you will be a future tennis champion .
Corrected sentence : Good luck !
Throughout my entire life , I have been dazzled by technological breakthroughs .
In school , I was passionately indulged in my studies , trying to understand how electrical gadgets work .
On the roads , I observed cars and wondered how they moved .
I enjoyed using technical devices and electrical gadgets , even in bed .
However , when I was a teenager , my mother had to undergo a surgical operation to remove part of her liver .
This type of surgery has a low mortality risk due to the low likelihood of human error .
Although the operation was successful , my mother was healthy again .
The doctor had to remove her ovaries during the surgery after he accidentally caused a hemorrhage in them .
He made a human mistake , and my mother barely survived her liver operation due to the unannounced removal of her ovaries .
The overwhelming panic that I felt during her operation and the pain we went through as a family after her surgery have changed the shape of my life forever .
Due to a human mistake , neither my life nor my mother 's life has ever been the same again .
Ever since that day , I have wanted to be an engineer to design a robotic system that can perform surgeries with high accuracy , thus eliminating the margin of human error .
I studied mechatronics engineering with the hope that one day , with enough knowledge and willpower , I would be able to work and contribute to the field of engineering .
The original sentence `` I am both hardworking and resilient . '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : I am both hardworking and resilient .
Living in my city , Aleppo , located in Syria , during the war has broadened my perspective and expanded my horizons .
I want to contribute to the improvement of my country and fix what the war has broken by providing inexpensive prostheses for the injured victims of war .
Therefore , master 's studies would enable me to put a smile on the face of a child who might have lost his legs , but this does not necessarily mean he has lost his right to play and enjoy his childhood .
I believe in lifelong learning , and I am enthusiastic about learning European languages in general , and German in particular .
After finishing my master 's program , I will prepare for my Ph.D . Besides studying in academic settings , I will continue learning and improving my German language skills while exploring Germany in my free time to learn about its enticing and wonderful culture .
I believe that we , as humans , are all equal , and we all have the same dreams and hopes .
Thus , I want to do my best to help every life on planet Earth lead a healthy and happy life .
Corrected sentence : Not just the present generation , but the entire human race as well .
I think that after attaining enough knowledge in the technical field , I will be able to extend the life expectancy of the human race with robots and systems that can work hand in hand to ensure human safety .
Corrected sentence : Whether by designing more intelligent systems to organize traffic or by developing robots that can conduct surgeries with lower risk .
Finally , I have to say that I feel the urge to help every human being I come across in my life , regardless of their race , gender , or ethnicity . I do think that we all have the power inside us to achieve our dreams ; we just need a strong motive and enough dedication .
The sky is the limit . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
The computer has been a major technological invention of great importance .
We are able to perform tasks such as writing letters at the push of a button , using programs , and even playing games with these masterpieces .
A person of any age can use a computer for business or pleasure , and generally , the machine is a significant enhancement in our ever-expanding , business-oriented world .
With health experts , however , our marvelous machine poses problems for our health that must not be ignored .
Apart from being a necessity for some , it makes human beings lazy to a certain extent and thus allows us to use our brains even less .
It is true to say that a computer is able to perform many hundreds of useful tasks to which our brains are completely indifferent .
But we ought to ask ourselves , `` What happens when the computer-oriented world collapses ?
We would then have to use our brains . '' Corrected sentence : `` We would then have to use our brains . '' ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
It is not sensible to put all our efforts and hopes into a machine that runs on electricity .
The brain must be exercised to allow for this possible clanger if we are disconnected from our precious computers .
We must educate ourselves more , especially our children , who are at the forefront of tomorrow 's technology .
Corrected sentence : Hello , Jo .
In my opinion , my country , Spain , is the best place to travel .
Here , you can find many wonderful cities and numerous places to visit .
I would like to recommend two cities for you to visit .
Firstly , you must visit Sevilla .
Sevilla is in southern Spain .
The original sentence `` It is a large city . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : It is a large city .
The original sentence `` It has a hot climate . '' is already grammatically correct . There are no errors to correct . Corrected sentence : It has a hot climate .
People there are very happy , and they celebrate their parties in the street .
It is very important to stay there in spring .
Corrected sentence : Secondly , Toledo .
Toledo is in the center of Spain .
Corrected sentence : It is a historic city .
Toledo was built on a mountain that has a river around it .
Toledo was a place where three cultures lived .
It has an important historical center , with many museums and places to visit .
Corrected sentence : Here in Spain , it is very easy to work if you want .
Although there are many people without a job , it is known that there are many temporary jobs available to work .
In summer , bars and restaurants need many waiters and cooks .
These employees are temporary ; you can get some money for your trip .
Corrected sentence : Warm regards . ( Note : The original sentence `` Warm regards . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
It seems that the provided sentence `` Rafa . '' is incomplete and lacks context . To correct it , I would need more information about what you intend to convey . However , if you meant to simply refer to someone named Rafa , a more complete sentence could be : '' Rafa is here . `` If you have a specific context or additional information , please provide that for a more accurate correction !
Dear Prime Editor , Recently , a significant number of local residents have been arguing about the construction of the recycling plant .
Like many others , I strongly believe it will involve several positive aspects for everyone .
In fact , almost all the residents in our local area are inclined to believe that building such a huge recycling plant will provide the jobs that we need .
Also , our neighborhood used to be one of the most attractive areas , but now there is an unbearably large increase in the amount of garbage that we want to get rid of .
Another reason is that protecting the environment has been very difficult to do , but by building the recycling plant , it will be much easier to keep our environment healthy .
Recycling not only saves the environment but also saves you money , as buying recycled items is a lot cheaper .
The government has a massive responsibility to enthuse people to recycle .
Finally , in my opinion , building the recycling plant is a great idea .
Corrected sentence : Factually , it is beneficial to both humans and the environment . Yours faithfully , Banhi Mohamed
Dear Tom ,
I am writing to apply for this summer camp job . I usually work with children of this age because I am a teacher , and when I finish , I usually prepare food for many children at the same school every day .
In my free time , I like preparing activities for children that are normally related to sports and evening activities .
I 'm often considered an energetic and cheerful person ; I put all my energy into the work that I do . I 'm a hardworking person .
Corrected sentence : If I have anything to do , I always win .
I 'm interested in this job because I want to learn and improve my work experience and my resume .
I think that I will be a suitable person for the job because I have all the qualities you need in a candidate .
Corrected sentence : Thank you for your consideration .
Corrected sentence : Goodbye .
If ever there was a false statement , it is this : `` There is no future for public transport because traveling by car is so much more convenient .
Corrected sentence : Traveling by car contributes to carbon monoxide poisoning in the atmosphere and creates global climate change .
Corrected sentence : It is harming the planet .
Our love of convenience will cause the end of our beautiful planet and , of course , us as well .
In most large cities around the world , cars are actually inconvenient , and most people rely on public transport to get around .
The Paris Metro , New York Subway , and London Underground are all integral parts of these teaming cities .
In many cities , there are not only massive traffic jams , but there is nowhere to park your car once you get to your destination .
If there is to be a public , they will need to use and enjoy public transportation .
The model does need some work ; however , it requires smaller and more frequent buses during most of the day , with the big buses only coming out during rush hours .
The future is all about public transport , with private gas-driven cars being a thing of the past .
If we make it past this disaster , we will be saying , `` What were we thinking ?
Television has become an important part of our daily life , and it has both advantages and disadvantages .
Nowadays , television is not only a source of entertainment and advertisements but also an impressive teaching aid for education . Its educational importance ca n't be underestimated as well .
It is becoming popular in schools ; additionally , its audio-visual quality makes educational programs more effective and interesting .
Corrected sentence : Hence , schools are making use of their potential for improving education .
Most of the schools in the United States of America have television sets , but lessons in the classroom are often boring and do not appeal to most students , so they do not attend .
To create interest in lessons , television is a good source .
In subjects like science and geography , there are many things that can be shown on television .
Corrected sentence : Hi , Nazanin !
The original sentence `` Thank you for the postcard . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : Thank you for the postcard .
Corrected sentence : It was very nice of you . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
Corrected sentence : How was your Easter holiday ?
My holiday was rather interesting , even extraordinary .
Corrected sentence : As you know , this year I celebrated Easter in Germany because the Easter vacations were very short .
So , I tried to celebrate Easter according to my Ukrainian folklore .
Traditionally , in the morning , we have Easter Mass in the church , and then Easter breakfast .
Before the mess , you must prepare a basket that contains traditional Easter food and bless it during this Easter mess .
It was not so easy to find all the food ...
Corrected sentence : But , at least Easter came .
The weather was amazing ; it was warm and sunny , in spite of the fact that the day before it had been cold , windy , and haily .
My two friends and I went to the railway station because the mess took place in Erfurt .
It was funny to take the basket through the town because it was windy , and I had to carry the basket very carefully not to leave the napkin behind .
The mess was supposed to start at 3 , but it actually started almost at 4 .
The mess lasted approximately two and a half hours , and then we expected to get home quickly because we were quite hungry .
Corrected sentence : But it held a little surprise for us ...
We took only a few steps , and suddenly it started to hail .
In a few minutes , it looked like it was winter outdoors .
It was not so easy to get to the railway station because it rained and hailed , and we did n't have any umbrella at all .
Corrected sentence : So , we missed one train and had to wait for nearly one hour .
We got home only near 8 , and we were very hungry , so we had our Easter supper .
We had spent a great time together .
The next day , my friends came to visit me .
Corrected sentence : It was really cool .
Hope my story was n't too long .
Corrected sentence : Have you already planned anything for next weekend ?
We can go anywhere together .
I 'm waiting for your answer . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
It seems that the sentence you provided is incomplete . Please provide the full sentence that contains grammatical errors , and I will be happy to help you identify and correct them .
To : MartaCorrected sentence : To Marta ,
It seems that the sentence you provided is incomplete . However , if you meant to provide a sentence related to `` Your family , '' please share the full sentence so I can help identify and correct any grammatical errors .
Hi Marta ,
I 'm writing because I want to invite you and your family to Menorca this summer .
I think that you can come in the first week of July .
You can stay at my home in the countryside .
Corrected sentence : When you come , we can go to the beach in the morning , and we can take a walk from Ciutadella in the evening . Do n't worry if you do n't want to spend a lot of money because we can have lunch and dinner at home .
The original sentence `` I 'm speaking with my daughter . '' is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors . Therefore , the corrected sentence remains the same : Corrected sentence : I 'm speaking with my daughter .
She is very happy because she wants to play tennis with your son .
Corrected sentence : Hope to hear from you soon !
It seems that the sentence provided is incomplete or lacks context . `` Mercè '' appears to be a name or a word in Catalan meaning `` thanks . '' If you could provide a complete sentence or more context , I would be happy to help identify and correct any grammatical errors .
We are experiencing a great economic crisis in Spain .
There is high inflation and a large underground economy ; as a result , the education system of our country ranks among the poorest in Europe , along with the United States and the UK .
The economic crisis is principally affecting education .
Corrected sentence : Politics is cutting back on the aid for studying .
There are more and more students who ca n't study because they receive little economic help .
One solution to this problem is to cut down on the salaries of people such as footballers , politicians , and commentators of trashy TV shows like Salvame .
Society is sure that if they do this , we students will get enough money to study .
The authorities have been working really hard to find ways to take care of the environment in the community .
They have a program in which the first rule is that all neighbors go out to clean every street one day per month .
People have to separate the garbage into organic and inorganic categories ; if they do n't do it , it will cause problems .
They have kept the garbage in their house ; still , they follow the rules .
Corrected sentence : People aboard the garbage truck do n't collect the garbage .
This line graph shows the number of visitors to a selection of different museums and galleries in Sharjah . Overall , the greatest number of visitors was at the Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilization , while the least number of visitors was at the Maraya Art Centre .
The most noticeable aspect of the data in the Sharjah Art Museum is that it started in 1991 and increased slightly until 2001 , then rose sharply to reach a peak of approximately 3.2 million visitors in 2006 . Secondly , if we look at the Sharjah Calligraphy Museum and the Sharjah Archaeology Museum , we can notice that both lines started in the same year , 1991 . The Archaeology Museum began with a number of 0.3 million visitors , then remained steady until 2001 , after which it increased sharply . The Calligraphy Museum started with 1 million visitors , decreased slightly to 0.9 million by 1996 , remained stable until 2006 , and then dropped to 0.5 million .
Nowadays , public transport seems to be one of the most suitable choices for us to travel .
This may be regarded as a rather difficult problem to solve .
More and more families are now getting used to buying individual cars instead of using public transport .
On the one hand , it is worth buying a car for our daily lives .
We can use it for a wide range of activities , such as taking our children to school , going to work , doing the shopping , and , of course , going on family vacations .
Prices might seem more expensive at first , but later on , cars tend to become very affordable .
Corrected sentence : But on the other hand , climate change is ahead of us ; we must ensure that every single person contributes to making our environment a better place for future generations .
For instance , we have many examples to prove that public transport itself is improving our environment .
London 's subway , for example , carries more than one thousand people each day .
People barely use their cars in crowded cities ; that is why public transport still has a unique role in our daily lives .
Furthermore , public transport is developing new environmentally friendly engines that may provide better conditions and renewed air for our community .
Investing in this type of transport is now becoming a traditional activity for those who have enough income to care about society .
To sum up , people will still be using public transport in the future , although new changes must be made in order to ensure its survival .
First of all , try to organize your sports and music time , and do your best to participate in both .
If you 're convinced you can not do both , think of two things : first , which activity will provide you with a better future , and second , which one of these activities you like the most . In my opinion ,
I think sports will give you a lot of benefits more than music because you do what you like and at the same time exercise .
I really hope this helps you .
Corrected sentence : Sincerely , Hector .
Many people believe that being famous is fantastic ; everyone on the street wants to get a picture with you , and you have many fans .
Being popular is cool because everyone knows you . Corrected sentence : Being popular is cool because everyone knows who you are .
Another good thing about it is that you are distinguishable .
On the other hand , all the time you 're being observed by cameras , paparazzi , and fans , even when you 're at home or on holiday with your family .
You ca n't even go shopping without being noticed . Corrected sentence : You ca n't even go shopping without being noticed . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . )
And I 'm sure that the next day your photo will be on the first page of the daily news .
Corrected sentence : What 's more , journalists are just waiting for your mistake , inaccurate statement , or compromising behavior .
Moreover , especially politicians are exposed to being attacked by brazen journalists who hunt for them .
In my opinion , famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them .
Corrected sentence : Nowadays , everyone wants to know what a private idol 's life looks like , so I think it 's very hard for famous people to save their own lives for themselves .
Nowadays , everything in the world is very developed , such as education , transport , people 's lives , and so on .
I 'm sure that in the future these will develop more .
In the future , education will grow significantly ; I think it will change how we teach and what we learn .
Scientists will create a pen that can write in space . With this pen , teachers wo n't need to go to a place with a board , as they can write wherever they want . Additionally , a device that helps students who ca n't go to school will include lessons , and with this device , they can discuss with their friends in a comfortable way .
Corrected sentence : In the next 50 years , cars that use the sun 's energy will become popular , and cars that cause environmental pollution will be eliminated .
The number of people who walk to school or the place where they work will increase .
This is a good change .
People 's lives will change , too . In this time , maybe each family will have a robot that does housework .
People do n't want to spend a lot of time on housework ; instead , they can relax after work or do some different activities .
Corrected sentence : People 's lifestyles will be more comfortable .
I reflect that there will be many changes in the future .
Corrected sentence : All About Me
Hello , I 'm Ailsa Dael Lam , and I 'm thirteen years old .
I was born in the Netherlands , in a town called Utrecht .
It is a nice town in the center of the Netherlands . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear , so no changes are necessary . )
Some people think I was born in Holland , but that is not correct .
The original sentence `` I was born in the Netherlands . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : I was born in the Netherlands .
Holland is a region in the west of the Netherlands .
Amsterdam , the capital of the country , is there too .
About two years before I was born , my sister Jette came into the world .
The original sentence `` She is now fifteen years old . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : She is now fifteen years old .
I also have a father named Geurt , which is a Dutch name that is hard for Swedish people to pronounce , and a mother named Willemien .
We have always had animals in our family .
Corrected sentence : Fred was the first cat I ever owned .
He was always in my crib when I was a baby .
He has a special voice .
It was loud , and everyone knew who he was because of that .
Corrected sentence : But now he is dead . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
He died when he was eighteen years old . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
Today we have a dog named Silas and two other cats called Selma and Romeo .
When Selma was one year old , she got five kittens .
Corrected sentence : One of them was Romeo . ( The original sentence is already grammatically correct . )
Today , they are not as nice to each other as they were when they were smaller .
I moved to Sweden ten years ago .
We moved because of our love for nature and our desire for adventure .
In the Netherlands , there is n't much nature .
When we moved to Sweden , I felt that the air was cleaner .
The original sentence `` We rented a house near the water . '' is already grammatically correct . There are no errors to correct . Corrected sentence : We rented a house near the water .
After a few years , we moved to the house on Edsviksvägen 118 in Danderyd , where we still live today .
We did n't move very far , but to a bigger and much nicer house .
Every Wednesday before I go to my dance class , I go to the Dutch school .
There I learn things about Dutch grammar so that I 'm on the same level as Dutch children my age .
Corrected sentence : If I want to , I can study in the Netherlands because of this opportunity .
I like to dance and play field hockey .
I play field hockey on Sundays , and I dance on Wednesdays and Saturdays .
Most Swedes do n't know what field hockey is , but it is a sport much like bandy ; the difference is that the stick is n't the same .
The original sentence is grammatically correct . However , if you want to enhance clarity or style , you could consider a slight rephrasing . Here ’ s a refined version : Corrected sentence : I feel happy and free when I play hockey and dance .
I like sports , but I definitely like animals too .
Last summer , I was in Spain with my cousins ; it was the best holiday ever .
We lived in a campsite near the sea .
There , I made my first scuba dive .
Corrected sentence : It was very funny .
When I slowly sank down into the water , I heard the sound of the bubbles .
I saw three red sea stars and many fish .
I would really like to dive in Australia someday .
I also swam a lot with my cousins . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
One of my favorite memories is when Selma got five kittens . Corrected sentence : One of my favorite memories is the time Selma got five kittens .
It was so nice to play with them , and they were so cute .
She got them one night in May . I heard the sound of a cat and woke up .
When I looked to my left , I saw Selma in a basket , but she was n't alone .
Corrected sentence : There were a few other kittens in the basket .
I called them Romeo , Rebecka , Suchi , Ronja , and Viggo .
All of them were white with black spots except for one , Ronja , who was black with a white stomach .
My favorite restaurant is Bonbon , which is located in Stockholm .
There , they have small dishes with fish , meat , or vegetables .
When you want one of the small dishes , they put a small ball in a glass .
When you have to pay , they look at how many balls are in the glass and then count how many you have to pay .
It 's very nice there , and you do n't have to choose one dish ; you can eat more smaller dishes .
I also like Italian food at restaurants like Ciao Ciao Duo in Stockholm .
When I 'm a grown-up , I want to be a veterinarian .
Corrected sentence : That 's because I love animals , and I want to help them when they are sick .
I think many veterinarians ask for too much money for something that you can also do at home .
I do n't want to be like that ; I want to start my own animal hospital .
The original sentence `` My favorite color is blue . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : My favorite color is blue .
It 's not just one sort of blue , but all sorts of blues .
I also like pink . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
I have many more favorite books than colors .
I really like the Hunger Games , but I also enjoy books by John Boyne , such as The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas .
I also like the books `` I Am Malala '' and `` The Kite Runner '' by Khaled Hosseini .
I like to read books about war and the Taliban because I think they are interesting and exciting .
These stories are often very sad , and I like to read that sort of story .
That was a little about me .
The original sentence `` Thank you for listening . '' is already grammatically correct . Therefore , no corrections are needed . Corrected sentence : Thank you for listening .
Corrected sentence : Ailsa Lam , 7A3 .
The recent developments in the field of genetic engineering have come largely as a result of discoveries made and techniques designed during this century , starting with the discovery of DNA and the mapping and understanding of its structure .
The manipulation of genes is an incredibly important and dangerously powerful ability that can not be left simply to the scientists to manage .
We are all now affected by the results of genetic engineering , be it for medical reasons or commercial ones .
Corrected sentence : Tomatoes are designed and engineered to last longer , apples to grow bigger , crops to ripen late to allow for transport time , and pigs are used to grow insulin for human use .
The list is enormous .
Corrected sentence : Along with the many advantages , there are also dangers .
New biological weapons are being developed all over the world ; for example , the ability to transfer the genes that cause cancer into a simple disease such as the common cold could , without much doubt , wipe out a significant percentage of the human race .
There need not be a war for something disastrous like this to occur ; these genetically engineered microbes could be released accidentally while being investigated in an unsealed laboratory .
If we are going to accept the advantages that come with genetic engineering , we must also take responsibility for the disadvantages . The stakes are too high to leave this job to the scientists , and they can not be expected to take moral responsibility for people who misuse the discoveries and inventions , thereby causing disaster .
Governments should ensure that money is invested not only in the research of genetic engineering but also in ensuring that the results of this research are kept safe .
I recommend visiting a Guido mine . Corrected sentence : I recommend visiting a Guido mine . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . If `` Guido mine '' refers to a specific place , it is appropriate as is . If `` Guido '' is meant to be an adjective or if there is a different intended meaning , please provide more context for further correction . )
It 's an old mine that was converted into a cultural zone in our city .
Of course , it 's still a mine , so you can see all the major equipment used ; Zabrze is located in Silesia , an area known for its coal mines .
It was set in 1855 by Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck , so the mine was named after him .
It has such a rich history that I ca n't just tell you everything in one email .
I can only say that the mine is divided into two levels : 170 and 320 .
The first one , level 170 , presents methods of mining , the work of miners in the late 19th century , and the history of that industry in Silesia .
This level is designed as an interactive form of sightseeing supported by lights and sounds .
The main assumption is to shock visitors and make them feel , and in my opinion , it surely does .
The visitors may be surprised by the noise of crackling ceiling or rats ' squealing .
There are also many exhibitions organized throughout the year .
A highly qualified guide is waiting for every group of visitors , and he 's ready for even the most serious avalanche of questions .
On the path of sightseeing , you can also find a chapel , a place that is very important for every minor and , of course , a place where important celebrations take place .
On level 320 , which resembles a real mine , you can see a longwall coal-cutting machine while it is working .
You can also touch real coal with your hand .
There are many concerts , exhibitions , and theatre plays organized too .
And if you get hungry , you can try something regional ; you can be sure that the cooks wo n't let you starve to death .
I think that the Guido Mine is well worth visiting .

If you meant to provide a longer sentence or a specific context , please share that , and I would be happy to help correct it . If you intended to keep it as is , a more complete version could be : `` I send you my love . '' Please provide more details if you have a specific sentence in mind !
It seems that the sentence you provided is just `` XYZ , '' which does not contain any grammatical errors or context to correct . If you have a specific sentence with grammatical errors that you would like me to help with , please provide that sentence , and I will be happy to assist you !
Nowadays , the aeroplane is treated as an ordinary part of our lives .
The original sentence is grammatically correct . However , if you are looking for a slight improvement in clarity , you could consider rephrasing it for emphasis . Here ’ s a refined version : Corrected sentence : Its primary purpose is to safely transfer people from one place to another .
However , a few decades ago , we had a very limited notion of such technology .
Corrected sentence : Yet , in the present , it is so ubiquitous that we seem not to take notice of the air business .
If one were to delve into the most paramount inventions of the last century , one would probably indicate modern conveniences , namely television or the computer .
We tend to underestimate the importance of the airplane .
It is obvious that air travel has had an enormous impact on the way we perceive the world .
Firstly , as a result of its development , we can experience a noticeable soar in mass tourism .
People have ample opportunities to embark on a riveting journey to places they previously imagined while reading an adventurous book .
Corrected sentence : Besides , the great influence of the aeroplane can be seen in mass emigration .
Had it not been for the Wright brothers , emigrants and casualties would not have been able to settle in remote lands ; hence , the world would teeter financially .
As far as the vast changes that the aeroplane has undergone are concerned , society 's attitude has also improved .
In the first place , for decades we had a distant relationship with such an initially fallible workhorse .
A classic illustration of this could be the use of aircraft only for military purposes .
Since the 20th century was marked by wars , we would only kill and exterminate people .
Additionally , creating such a vehicle has been our morbid fascination since time immemorial .
Nonetheless , the situation has somewhat normalized .
Air travel has converted from a luxury at the disposal of the rich to a common mode of transportation available to almost everyone .
I personally believe that the influence the aeroplane has had on our lives is significant ; yet , we have to bear in mind the dangers connected with it .
For instance , at the beginning of the 21st century , tourists have been under the constant threat of terrorists .
Moreover , the opportunities that air technology brings may easily contribute to further development .
Perhaps it will improve to such an extent that commuting from Tokyo to London will be in the twinkling of an eye .
To sum up , the airline industry and its changes have been important for the world .
Corrected sentence : Apart from minor drawbacks , we can only praise its benefits .
It has certainly had an edifying effect on our thinking about traveling .
Many years ago , people lived without all the things we have nowadays , such as mobile phones , LED TVs , computers , etc .
This means that we have experienced an important change over time ; it is due to the rise of technology , and it entails that people 's lives are changing .
Corrected sentence : Now , will we continue to develop our technology and our lives ?
From my point of view , technology will continue to change our lives in various aspects of our routines and free time , to the point that we will not be able to live without using it .
It is a problem ; we must not depend on items like phones , TVs , and all products created by technology .
If we had to live in the past , bearing in mind all our dependency on technology , we would not be able to live in this way ; I am sure of it .
Nonetheless , I think that people 's lives will improve thanks to technology . This is not only referring to the negative aspects , such as dependency on technology , but also to the interesting advancements it offers , like new technologies and information systems that can enhance the job market and improve a wide range of sectors , including agriculture and healthcare .
Finally , to sum up , I think that people 's lives will change , but not dramatically ; it depends on each person and the way in which they focus their lives .
Unfortunately , I have n't seen any thrillers for ages .
I prefer other genres . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct . No changes are needed . )
I saw a really great comedy film by Wes Anderson last month .
The corrected sentence is : Its title is The Grand Budapest Hotel .
The story took place in Eastern Europe between the two World Wars .
The hotel manager used to take care of his regular clients , especially elderly ladies .
The hotel flourished , and the manager felt like a god and behaved as if he were in his small universe .
He hired the teenage Indian refugee as a bellboy and taught him all of his skills .
He gave the boy a lot of lessons in hospitality , friendship , courage , and humanity .
An old man returned to the place of his youth and told the story of his friend and mentor .
Nowadays , public transport is less convenient than traveling by car because there are other solutions , like internet platforms that allow people to share rides for a relatively low price with others who are going to the same destination .
Sharing the car could be an alternative to save money , but it is also more comfortable than traveling with a lot of people .
First of all , public transport has fewer combinations ; it is too difficult to travel , for example , if you have to work at night and on special days , as it is impossible to find a seat .
On the other hand , if you have missed the bus , train , or any other public transport , you have to wait a long time between them , and it results in frustration .
In conclusion , people prefer traveling by car because it is more comfortable ; you can go wherever you want at the time you consider best and choose whether to share the space with others or not .
Nowadays , people spend lots of money in order to go to an English-speaking country to improve their language skills .
Corrected sentence : But is it really the most effective way to learn a language ?
From my point of view , studying in a foreign country has some drawbacks .
Corrected sentence : Firstly , this method is very expensive because the tuition fees for overseas students are quite high .
The original sentence is grammatically correct and clear . However , if you are looking for a slightly refined version for improved clarity , it could be : '' Additionally , when you study abroad , you must adapt to a very different way of life , which can be quite stressful .
What is more , English teachers do not speak Russian , so if you do n't know English well , you will not understand their explanations .
It is often assumed that it is better to study a language abroad because you can always use it when speaking with native speakers .
However , I doubt that we will have many opportunities to speak abroad , as we do not know many people there .
It is also believed that Russian teachers are not as qualified as their counterparts in England .
I completely disagree with this opinion because Russian teachers can compare two languages and explain grammar rules more effectively .
To sum up , I would argue that the best way to learn a language is to study it in your native country , where you can always get the necessary help from your teachers .
Moreover , today we have many opportunities to improve our skills , such as communicating with English pen friends over the Internet .
I think that we should travel abroad to practice a language , but not to study it .
