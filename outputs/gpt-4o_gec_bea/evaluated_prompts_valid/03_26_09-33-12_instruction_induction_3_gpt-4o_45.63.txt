It's difficult to answer the question "What are you going to do in the future?" if the only one who has to know is in two minds.
When I was younger, I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher, a saleswoman, and even a butcher. I don't know why.
I would like to study psychology because one day I would like to open my own psychology office and help people.
It's difficult because I'll have to study hard and a lot, but I think that if you like a subject, you'll study it more easily.
The sentence is already grammatically correct. No changes are needed.
I think that public transport will always be important in the future.
The rich people will buy a car, but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi.
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in your own car than when traveling by bus.
Also, you'll meet friendly people who usually ask you to be friends and exchange telephone numbers.
In my experience, when I didn't have a car, I used to take the bus to go to school and return to my house.
In my opinion, a car isn't necessary when you have crashed in the street; in that moment, you realize the importance of public transport.
In India, we have various types of public transport, such as cycling, biking, cars, trains, and flights.
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place, the mode of transport is chosen accordingly.
Generally speaking, traveling by car is much more fun compared to other modes of transport.
This reminds me of a trip that I recently went on to Agra.
It takes around 6 hours by national highway to go from Delhi to Agra.
We have stopped at hotels to have food, and just in case any of us feels hungry, we purchased some snacks just before the trip.
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want when we travel by car (which is impossible when traveling by train or flight).
In addition, we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up refreshed.
Due to the above-mentioned reasons, I am going to conclude that traveling by car is much more convenient.
My name is Sarah.
I am 17 years old.
I am looking forward to joining you in this year's summer camps.
I love children, and I enjoy looking after them. Also, I organized many sports activities before in my school.
In addition to that, I enjoy cooking.
My family thinks that my cooking is amazing.
I hope that you give me the chance to join you.
Thanks.
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends.
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere. When I travel to the beach, I like to play with my sister in the sand, and afterward, we go to the sea.
It is very funny.
When I was young, I liked playing with the ball in the playground, and my friend and I used the soccer goals as a volleyball net.
Dear Jo,
How are you? I'm writing to inform you that I need some advice on traveling and working in my country.
On the one hand, in my country there are a lot of places to travel.
For example: Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia.
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit. For example, in Madrid, you can visit "Puerta del Sol" and "Las Cibeles.
I visit Madrid twice a year.
All summer, I visit Sevilla because I love this city, and I suggest that you visit Sevilla.
On the other hand, in my country, there are few jobs because the economy is very bad.
But, if you want, I will look for a job for you.
My best friend is looking for a person responsible for looking after her sister.
Her sister is 6 years old, and you should look after her every weekend.
You will be interested in this job.
Thank you for your email; it was wonderful to hear from you.
I'm looking forward to seeing you.
Take care, Laura.
Today, public transport still plays an important role in the transport system, and it will continue to do so in the future.
Because public transport is a cost-effective means of resource allocation in the mass transport system.
Also, people need not suffer the high operating costs of running their own cars.
But they can use a cheaper way to get to their destination, especially if it is far from home.
For example, I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane for traveling to another country.
Instead, it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane.
In my opinion, public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people who don't have enough money to pay for a car, even if it is used. Therefore, public transport will continue to have a future, but people are going to use cars more than buses or the underground.
If we think about it, the car is better because we don't need to wait for it as we do when waiting for the bus or underground, but in another way, a car costs more money than public transport.
By car, we can just stay by ourselves, which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like, and we don't need to be around people who are unknown. However, if we choose public transport, we can meet friends or family. So, both modes of transportation are good, and cars don't necessarily need to replace public transport.
If I had to choose between both modes of transportation, I think I would probably choose a car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus.
In my community, we are very interested in the environment and ecological things.
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden, with worms that eat and degrade all the organic waste from the school.
In some strategic points of the building, we have special trashcans to separate the garbage into organic, paper and cardboard, cans, and PET bottles, and they also hold talks and presentations about environmental problems like global warming and contamination.
The manager of all these projects is Miss June Sid, our science teacher.
All these initiatives have made us, over the years, a recognized ecological community.
Good morning, everyone. Today I want to share with you my favorite sport.
My favorite sport is football. Why do I choose it? Well, football is an international sport, and people around the world love it so much! Examples include the Barclays Premier League, the Premier League, the FIFA World Cup, and so on.
I believe that will delight us all.
By the way, my favorite football team is Manchester United. They are brilliant, they have amazing football players, and they are awesome.
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream: to be a superhero!
After many years, he still dreams of becoming a superhero.
He entered the university of medicine because he thinks that this profession is the most similar to being a superhero.
After some years at the university, he met a girl named Kate, and he fell in love with her, and she fell in love with him.
Kate was cursing the University of Fashion.
The sentence "Then the two started to date." is grammatically correct. No changes are needed.
Michael and Kate were so happy until one day when Michael said his dream was to be a superhero. Kate got so nervous, saying that it was ridiculous and just a child's dream, and that Michael was only dreaming, but it would never happen and that superheroes don't exist.
When she said that, Michael started to cry and get mad, saying that she was lying and didn't have a heart.
The sentence is already grammatically correct. Therefore, it remains unchanged:He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment.
The following day, she apologized, and they were happy again.
But when they get to Michael's home, they fight again, and Michael gets a knife and kills her.
He cried with a lot of blood around.
Michael, get away from there.
The sentence is already grammatically correct. No changes are needed.
Public transportation is an important invention in human history; it brings numerous benefits to our lives.
For instance, we take the subway in order to avoid getting stuck in traffic.
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than taking public transportation; however, it would cause more damage to our lives and harm our environment.
Therefore, we need to think more about our future, our offspring.
To give them a safe, clean, and comfortable place to live.
If there is no public transportation, traffic jams will be more serious than before.
In my country, Taipei, we always get stuck in traffic for about one hour in the morning.
I cannot imagine how long it would take to get to school if there were no bus or MRT.
Cars are convenient for humans, but they also cause damage to humans.
For example, carbon dioxide, which is created by cars.
It causes global warming, which threatens our environment and harms our daily life.
We can see that there have been many serious and frequent weather disasters in recent decades, such as typhoons, hurricanes, wildfires, and mudslides.
What other precautions are usually taken?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film is shipped.
If the film doesn't arrive on time, it will be canceled immediately.
Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process is started right away.
The pleasure of traveling
People come, people go.
Every day, lots of people are traveling abroad, but what's the best way to travel internationally?
The most important option for travel is, by far, the plane.
