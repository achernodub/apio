It's difficult to answer the question "What are you going to do in the future?" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds.
When I was younger, I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher, a saleswoman, and even a butcher. I don't know why.
I would like to study psychology because one day I would like to open my own psychology office and help people.
It's difficult because I'll have to study hard and a lot, but I think that if you like a subject, you'll find it easier to study.
Maybe I'll change my mind; maybe not.
I think that public transport will always exist in the future.
The rich people will buy a car, but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi.
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in your own car than when traveling by bus.
Also, you'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something to become friends and exchange telephone numbers.
In my experience, when I didn't have a car, I used to take the bus to go to school and return to my house.
In my opinion, a car isn't necessary when you have crashed in the street; at that moment, you realize the importance of public transport.
In India, we have various types of public transport, like cycles, bikes, cars, trains, and flights.
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place, the mode of transport is chosen accordingly.
But generally speaking, traveling by car is much more fun compared to other modes of transport.
This reminds me of a trip that I recently took to Agra.
It takes around 6 hours by national highway to go from Delhi to Agra.
We stopped at hotels to have food, and just in case any of us felt hungry, we purchased some snacks just before the trip.
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car (which is impossible when traveling by train or flight), we have more flexibility.
In addition to that, we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up refreshed.
Due to the above-mentioned reasons, I am going to conclude that traveling by car is much more convenient.
My name is Sarah.
I am 17 years old.
I am looking forward to joining you in this year's summer camps.
I love children, and I enjoy looking after them. Also, I organized many sports activities before in my school.
In addition to that, I enjoy cooking.
My family thinks that my cooking is amazing.
I hope that you give me the chance to join you.
Thanks.
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends.
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere. When I travel to the beach, I like to play with my sister in the sand, and afterward, we go to the sea.
It is very funny.
When I was young, I liked playing with the ball in the playground, and my friend and I used the soccer goals as a volleyball net.
Dear Jo,
How are you? I'm writing to provide you with some advice on traveling and working in my country.
On the one hand, in my country, there are a lot of places to travel.
For example, Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, and Valencia.
There are wonderful cities with a lot of things to visit; for example, in Madrid, you can visit "Puerta del Sol" and "Las Cibeles.
I visit Madrid twice a year. (Note: The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes.)
All summer, I visit Sevilla because I love this city, and I suggest that you visit it too.
On the other hand, in my country, there are few jobs because the economy is very bad.
But, if you want, I can look for a job for you.
My best friend is looking for someone responsible to look after her sister.
Her sister is 6 years old, and you should look after her every weekend.
Are you interested in this job?
Thank you for your e-mail; it was wonderful to hear from you.
The sentence "I'm looking forward to seeing you." is already correct and does not require any changes.
The sentence "Take care, Laura." is already correct and does not require any changes.
Today, public transport still plays an important role in the transport system, and it will continue to do so in the future.
Public transport is a cost-effective and better resource allocation in the mass transport system.
Also, people need not suffer the high operating costs of running their own car.
But they can use a cheaper way to get to their destination, especially if it is far away from home.
For example, I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane for traveling to another country.
Corrected sentence: Instead, it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane.
In my opinion, I think that public transport will continue to be used in the future because there are many people who don't have enough money to pay for a car, even a used one. Therefore, public transport will still have a future, but people are likely to use cars more than buses or the underground.
If we think about it, the car is better because we don't need to wait for it as we do when waiting for the bus or underground. However, in another way, a car costs more money than public transport.
By car, we can just stay by ourselves, which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like, and we don't need to be around people we don't know. However, if we choose public transport, we can meet friends or family. So, both modes of transportation have their benefits, and cars don't necessarily need to replace public transport.
If I had to choose between both modes of transportation, I think I would probably choose a car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus.
In my community, we are very interested in the environment and ecological issues.
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden, with worms that eat and degrade all the organic waste from the school.
In some strategic points of the building, we have special trashcans to separate the garbage into categories such as organic, paper and cardboard, cans, and PET bottles. They also conducted talks and presentations about environmental issues like global warming and contamination.
The manager of this entire project is Miss June Sid, our science teacher.
All these initiatives have made us, over the years, a recognized ecological community.
Good morning, everyone. Today I want to share with you my favorite sport.
My favorite sport is football. Why do I choose it? Well, football is an international sport, and people around the world love it so much! Examples include the Barclays Premier League, the Premier League, the FIFA World Cup, and so on.
I believe that's all that will delight us.
By the way, my favorite football team is Manchester United. They are brilliant, they have amazing football players, and they are awesome.
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream: to be a superhero!
After many years, he still dreams of becoming a superhero.
He entered the university of medicine because he thought that this profession was the most similar to being a superhero.
After some years at the university, he met a girl named Kate, and he fell in love with her, and she fell in love with him.
Kate was cursing the University of Fashion.
Then the two started dating.
Michael and Kate were so happy until one day when Michael shared his dream of becoming a superhero. Kate became nervous, saying that it was ridiculous and just a child's dream, and that Michael was only dreaming. She insisted that it would never happen and that superheroes don't exist.
When she said that, Michael started to cry and get mad, saying that she was lying and didn't have a heart.
He got so mad that he asked her to leave his apartment.
In the following day, she said sorry and they were happy again.
But when they get to Michael's home, they fight again, and Michael gets a knife and kills her.
He cried with a lot of blood around.
Michael, get away from there.
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake.
Public transportation is an important invention in human history; it brings a number of benefits to our lives.
For instance, we take the subway in order to avoid getting stuck in traffic.
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than taking public transportation; however, it would cause more damage to our lives and harm our environment.
Therefore, we need to think more about our future, our offspring.
Giving them a safe, clean, and comfortable place to live is important.
If there is no public transportation, traffic jams will be more serious than before.
In my country, Taipei, we always get stuck in traffic for about one hour in the morning.
I cannot imagine if there were no bus or MRT, how long it would take me to get to school.
The car is convenient for humans, but it also causes damage to them.
For example, carbon dioxide, which is created by cars.
It causes global warming, which threatens our environment and harms our daily life.
We can see that there have been many serious and frequent weather disasters in recent decades, such as typhoons, hurricanes, wildfires, and mudslides.
What other precautions are usually taken?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film is shipped.
If the film doesn't arrive on time, it will be canceled immediately.
Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process is started right away.
The pleasure of traveling is unmatched.
The original sentence "People go, people come." is already correct and does not require any changes.
Every day, lots of people are traveling abroad, but what's the best way to do international travel?
The most important option for travel is, by far, the plane.
