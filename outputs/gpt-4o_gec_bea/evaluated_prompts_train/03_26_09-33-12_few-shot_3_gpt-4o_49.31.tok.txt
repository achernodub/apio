But even though it 's true that it 's the faster option , you must be very careful when getting off a plane .
If you are looking for comfort and relaxation , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There is a wide variety of things to do and enjoy on the trip .
Although the better option is to pick out a train .
There is no comparison to watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the journey , and , best of all , it 's the cheapest way to get away for a few days and break the routine .
Anyway , no matter how you go or where you go .
The pleasure of traveling is in the travel itself .
Transportation is one of the most important things in life , so we have many kinds of transportation . Now , we travel by car , but in the near future , there will be other comfortable and easy ways to travel , like fast trains and planes that can transport you from north to south in less than an hour . This will make businesspeople happy and comfortable because it saves a lot of time and effort . We hope that the government can achieve this as soon as possible .
In modern societies , we have lots of friends in our daily lives .
Big projects could not be finished without cooperation .
Friends could communicate and exchange ideas , feelings , and funny things that happened around us .
More importantly , parents give us life and teach us the knowledge , skills , and abilities needed to live in this world .
In this case , the families played important roles in daily life .
The original sentence `` The reasons are as follows . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
First of all , we can learn lots of skills from our parents based on their own experiences .
For example , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a meal from our parents .
Secondly , the families could give you some advice about how to deal with things that might cause trouble .
If the difficulties were communicated to the families , they would come up with ideas and discuss with you how to solve the situation .
All in all , in this case , the family is the most important friend in our lives .
The field of computing technology has advanced significantly in recent years , making old computers almost obsolete and widening the gap between old and new computers with every new discovery .
As we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different . Starting with the size of the computers , old computers were much bigger than new computers .
Old computers used to occupy an entire room ; now , they are only the size of a box , or even the size of a book .
You can have a portable computer now and take it with you to every place you visit .
Old computers only let you perform mathematical tasks or play simple games with two colors ( green and black ) . Now , you can do whatever you want , like creating or playing video games , writing or reading a book , connecting to the internet , watching or making videos , and inventing new things to improve computing technology , all in thousands of colors .
One of the greatest achievements of new computing is the internet , where you can connect to other computers , download stuff , etc. , via Ethernet cable or wireless connection ( Wi-Fi ) .
Get wrecked , mate .
I went to the abandoned house and started to think of the best way to make his life miserable . I spent the next two weeks looking for ideas to make him suffer .
I 'm happy to help you correct and improve the sentence . Here 's a revised version : As I did n't find anything , I went to the place he lived and started to look for some information about his life . I found people he cared about , and as I continued to go to his house , I noticed he would always go to the same house . So , I decided to follow him there and found out he was dating a girl who might be his girlfriend . I finally got an idea : I would drive him crazy just as he did with me , so she would think he had problems and leave him . But soon I thought about it again and realized that if I did that , she might try to help him , and they would become more united . So , I decided to drive them both crazy , almost to the brink of madness , just as he did with me !
But wait a minute , am I really so angry to do this ?
Yes !
I screamed ; my anger had dominated my mind . I no longer had control over my actions . I was afraid of what I had become and what I could do , but I could not control myself . The only thing I could think of was him suffering a slow death and the satisfaction I would feel when I finally had my revengeâ€”the best revenge .
I 'm sorry to hear about your situation . Here 's a corrected version of the sentence : But I was so mad at him and so anxious to make his life impossible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and bigger . I had made a decision ; I was going to do it . If he dedicated four years of his life to torturing me and not wanting me to be happy , I would take the time necessary for him to have a miserable life , and I would n't stop until I had accomplished my goal .
I 'm not in agreement with this idea completely .
On the one hand , traveling by car is much more convenient as it gives you the chance to be independent .
On the other hand , huge traffic jams are a big issue for traveling by car .

Public transportation has been used more by people , and over the years , it has become somewhat cheaper and also safer . However , some people prefer cars . To what extent do we agree with this , and what are our reasons for that ? This is what we are going to demonstrate in this essay .
About 40 years ago , there was nothing called public transportation , and people rarely owned cars . In those years , there were not even good facilities to move from one place to another because there were no companies to build cars . However , in about 10 years , car trading became viable and gained its own supporters . At the beginning , they faced a lot of problems , but they were able to solve them by the end .
Nowadays , all modes of travel are more convenient , from cars to buses , and even trains and planes . Some people prefer cars because they do not like crowded places or because they find it sometimes cheaper . However , from another point of view , public transportation is very cheap and even faster . When it comes to traveling , a lot of people prefer driving their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by escaping crowded places .
To summarize , it is different from one person 's opinion to another . I predict that public transportation will be improved , and people will use it more and more , so that by the end , cars will disappear and will no longer be used .
The topic itself explains the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of car companies and the exponential growth in their sales figures . With low-budget private cars in the picture , the scenario has drastically changed in the past 10 years .
Development of the biodiesel industry can contribute to productivity growth .
A large scale of investment was brought for biofuel development .
Meanwhile , it boosts economic growth and job opportunities , thereby enhancing Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
If you are living in a big town or a small one , it does matter , but one thing that should be taken care of by the people and organizers of the town is the environment .
Global warming is a huge issue in today 's world .
The government should take significant action to stop it or at least slow it down .
However , we , the people , have a really important part in making it worse .
An active and good government understands the value of taking care of trees , water , air , and much more to provide a fresh , clean , and safe environment for its people .
Recycling items can be a good step to start with for a clean and safe environment , which is perfectly and promptly taken care of by my city .
Everyone has to plant a tree in front of their home according to the rule of the provincial government .
People are not realizing that cutting down trees can reduce the production of oxygen in the atmosphere .
Eventually , humans will have no more fresh air to breathe .
Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas and for those under 18 years old , and it provides free sessions of talks or presentations to increase awareness of a clean , safe , and fresh environment in the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest to our neighboring cities to take part in cleaning the environment so that one day it can be seen throughout the whole country .
Everybody has their favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football .
On our school or village football stadium , I spend a lot of time every day .
Usually , I play football with my classmates .
Before training , I ran 1-2 kilometers , and my legs gained strength while my body gained energy .
Our team has a hard-working coach , and he gives us professional advice on how to improve our football skills .
His main words were : `` You must work very hard if you want to achieve high results .
I can say that the coach is an experienced person .
Not so long ago , we had a competition .
We got first place .
We have achieved this result because we are friendly and organized .
I believe that in the future I will be a famous football player in teams such as Shakhtar or Dynamo .
Football is my life .
I want to give advice to someone who starts this sport : `` You must believe in yourself .
