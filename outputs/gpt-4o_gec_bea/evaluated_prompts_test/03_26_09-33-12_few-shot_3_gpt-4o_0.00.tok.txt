Dear Sir ,
I saw your advertisement for a job on the internet , and I am writing to apply for a summer position as an instructor and caretaker of children at your camp .
I am working as a teacher in a Spanish school with children aged between 8 and 14 .
I am an easy-going person with a lot of empathy for children .
On the other hand , in my leisure time , I usually do sports like jogging or swimming , and adventurous activities like trekking , climbing , or spelunking , which I have been doing for 20 years .
I have traveled around most European countries , and I am able to understand , speak , and write fluently in three languages : Spanish , English , and French .
It is the reason why I believe that I could be a suitable candidate for the job .
I would like to tell you that I will be able to work in the months of July and August .
I hope it has not been an inconvenience to you .
To the end , could you please tell me what salary you are offering for this job ?
I look forward to hearing from you.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Best regards ,
The sentence `` Mirta Rojo '' is not a complete sentence , so it does n't require correction in the same way as the others . If `` Mirta Rojo '' is intended to be a name or title , it is already correct . If you intended to convey more information , you might consider expanding it into a full sentence . For example : - `` Mirta Rojo is a talented artist . '' - `` I met Mirta Rojo at the conference . `` If you provide more context , I can help further !
Hi . I am so happy to write here . My favorite sport is riding a bike ( bicycle ) .
It is a nice and good sport , especially when we try it in the morning . It gives the body energy and regulates the work of the heart .
For me , I used to do this kind of sport for ten minutes daily . I do this sport because I have liked it since my childhood .
My advice to anyone starting to learn this sport is to be careful of accidents because it requires more concentration from the person to ride . That is all .
Thank you .
I 've been studying English for several years , but I 'm not really sure what exactly my current goal is .
I 've been changing places , and I do n't know which one is the best for me .
What I 'm sure about is the fact that I 'm going to need an official certificate in order to prove that I 've studied the language .
I study English because I love it , and I 'd like to speak very fluently and watch movies without subtitles .
I understand perfectly when a native speaker is talking , but when I have to talk in English , it 's not so easy .
I 'm very motivated and I 'm going to continue with my studies , but I need to be clear about where I 'm going .
I 'd like to teach the language to young children .
Next year , I 'm going to focus on speaking , and perhaps I will do a formal test .
Otherwise , I 'd like to improve my grammar and writing , so I 'll keep on trying hard .
Thank you for helping me . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The British parliamentary electoral system is unfair and undemocratic . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
It is , however , in my opinion , the best basis for government .
Consider a general election in which three parties stand—X , Y , and Z—in a country of 5,000 voters .
Supposing 2000 people vote for party X and 1500 vote for parties Y and Z , party X would come into power because they had the most votes .
However , there were 3,000 people who did not want them to be in power , which is not the majority of the country .
Also , the idea of each constituency having an MP who fights for that constituency 's beliefs in parliament is important .
This sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Consider , for example , the MP who recently decided she wanted to switch parties .
Yes , I know it is the MP 's belief that the constituents are meant to vote on the ideas of that MP , but this simply is n't the case in many circumstances . The voter votes based on how the party that the MP represents is doing at the moment .
Once a party is in government , it is free to do as it likes , changing its policies , until the next general election , at which point it will make hollow promises about what it will do when it next gets in power , just to gain votes .
It is , as I said before , the best system . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Consider dictatorships ; this falls at the first hurdle .
With this system , any madman can control a country , causing economic disasters not only for that country but also for other related countries .
There is no fair and perfect way to run a country.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
One can please some people some of the time , but not all people all of the time .
The only way a fair system of government can come about is in a group of about ten people at the most , and even then , people are discontent .
Hi Karina ,
Thanks for your letter .
Of course , I can tell you about Dulan .
He 's 23 , and he 's studying electronic engineering at Kelaniya University , and he 's a second-year student .
He has an elder sister who has just finished her IT degree , and now she is looking for a job .
His mother teaches biology to advanced level students at Ananda College , Colombo 10 , and his father works at People 's Bank as an assistant manager .
He 's a cool , charming , and very sociable person .
The original sentence `` He 's also sensitive . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
When someone faces a trouble , he does n't look at others ; he goes forward to help them as much as he can .
Not only that , he 's a responsible and reliable guy .
Sometimes he borrows my personal things ( laptop , pen drives ) and returns them to me on time , just as they were .
He 's incredibly hard-working . That 's the secret behind his exam results .
He likes going out with friends , watching movies , and listening to music using his hi-fi headset , so do n't worry about noise ! He 's a good rugby player , and he plays for his university team . He 's crazy about computer games .
He had already finished many famous computer games when we left school , but he knew his limits and knew how to manage his studies without any disturbance .
He 's keen on sports cars . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
He has a large collection of pictures and videos of sports cars .
Also , he has quite a good knowledge of automobiles .
I know that most of the time , he does some repairs himself .
So it may be helpful for you during your holiday .
The only negative things I can think of are that he 's a bit untidy and not well-organized .
His room is usually a mess , and sometimes he looks for his belongings for hours .
His English writing is very good , but he is n't a fluent speaker . I 'm sure he 'll learn it fast .
Finally , I think he 's really nice , and that you and your family will get on well with him .
I hope the above information is useful .
Let me know if you need more information about him . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
It seems like the sentence `` Love , '' is incomplete . If you intended to write a closing for a letter or message , it might look like this : '' Love , [ Your Name ] '' If you meant to start a sentence with `` Love , '' you might want to provide more context or complete the thought . For example : '' Love , in its purest form , is selfless and unconditional . `` If you have a specific context or continuation in mind , please let me know !
It seems like `` Lioyni '' might be a typo or an incomplete word . Could you provide more context or clarify what the intended sentence or word should be ?
A very important characteristic of the UK constitution , and one that is central to the question of sovereignty , is that the Westminster Parliament is the supreme legal authority in the UK .
According to the orthodox school , which subscribes to the views of Albert Venn Dicey , the Westminster Parliament is omnicompetent and can pass laws on any subject it likes to regulate the activities of any person , anywhere , even those of aliens outside British territory .
In theory , then , the Westminster Parliament could pass a law banning smoking on the streets of Paris . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
If our Parliament did so , British courts would be obliged to accept Parliament 's decision and pass judgment accordingly .
Of course , in practice , as the Radical school ( who believe that the Westminster Parliament is not legislatively supreme ) points out , in this hypothetical situation , the Parisians would take no notice whatsoever of the UK Parliament 's legislation ; and Parliament would , in effect , be fettered .
Dicey said that , as each Parliament is omnipotent and therefore has the power to make or unmake any law , no Parliament could bind its successors as to the content or manner and form of subsequent legislation .
The Radicals like to point out that since the passing of the European Communities Act in 1972 , the Westminster Parliament has ceded its sovereignty and supremacy to Europe .
The orthodox school retaliates by pointing out that since a Westminster Parliament passed the 1972 Act , thereby putting the UK into the European Communities , a future Parliament could just as easily repeal this Act and take us out of Europe again .
In this case , Britain would have retained its sovereignty and Parliamentary supremacy .
Of course , this whole question is still a subject of fierce debate . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
British courts have avoided a head-on clash by finding ambiguity in a domestic statute and resolving that ambiguity to give effect to our Community obligations , by finding that a statute passed prior to the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed by implication by that Act and does not represent the latest intention of the Westminster Parliament , or by arguing that subsequent legislation was inadvertent and that the Westminster Parliament could not have intended to come into conflict with Community law .
In a recent development , the European Court of Justice ruled in the case of R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame and others ( 1990 ) that courts in Britain must suspend an Act of the Westminster Parliament where the rights of the citizens guaranteed by European Community law may be at risk .
This case , for the first time , stated that it is a principle of UK law , as influenced by the European Court , that our Parliament is not supreme in every circumstance .
It would seem , therefore , that the advent of a single Europe indeed means a loss of sovereignty for Britain , whatever the orthodox school may think to the contrary .
Young people are interested in many things , such as games , music , television programs , and the clothes they wear .
Young people , like children , enjoy playing games , listening to music , watching TV , and wearing special clothes .
Now , in 2015 , the game that young people are interested in is speed stacking .
In music , they are interested in Taylor Swift songs because they are so wonderful ; even I listen to them every day .
Television programmes are not actually liked by young people , but they do enjoy channels that have horror films , romantic films , and films with happy endings .
This year , there are fantastic clothes everywhere , especially in the UAE .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in connection with your job advertisement for the summer camps in the USA .
I am a twenty-year-old student from Poland , and I am looking for an interesting job for the summer holidays .
I would like to apply for the job you are offering , and I intend to prove that I am an appropriate candidate .
In Poland , I have been a Scout for ten years .
There , I had various tasks ; one of them was looking after younger children .
I helped organize Scout camps all over my country .
We organized many sports and cultural activities .
Apart from being a Scout , I have also been a lifeguard at kitesurfing camps in Poland .
The original sentence `` I am not afraid of the work in the kitchen . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence is already correct . However , if you want to make a slight adjustment for clarity or style , you could rephrase it as : '' I am also capable of performing more challenging tasks , such as washing the dishes or tidying up .
I believe you will consider my application .
The sentence `` Yours faithfully , '' is already correct and does not require any changes . It is a standard closing for a formal letter when the recipient 's name is not known .
Please provide the sentence `` XYZ '' that you would like corrected , and I 'll be happy to help !
I beg to differ : crime does pay .
Many criminals live far better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime .
Being a criminal has its advantages : you do n't have to worry about being fired , you can make more money in less time , you set your own hours because you 're your own boss , and you can retire well before the age of 65 .
Let 's take time to compare the life of a criminal to the life of a hard-working person .
In our changing economy , any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with whether or not he or she will continue to have that job .
Many people are being laid off or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees .
A criminal will always find employment .
There is never a lack of work or a means for continuing employment .
Corrected sentence : Then , if we think about the workday of most working people , we can see how it impacts their daily lives .
The average worker works eight hours per day .
They earn about $ 7.50 per hour for their labor .
This is $ 300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Tax deductions will run about $ 69.00 per week , and deductions for medical/dental insurance will cost them another $ 5.00 per week , bringing their actual take-home pay to $ 266.00 per week .
The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $ 300.00 without having to worry about deductions for medical insurance and taxes .
Further , the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific number of hours each day .
The criminal is their own boss .
And finally , the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker is retirement .
However , the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they ( the criminal ) have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years .
If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 , he or she could be set for life .
At $ 300.00 per hour over 15 years , the criminal earns $ 1,170,000.00 .
If he or she invests half of this money and earns interest , they could potentially live on the interest income alone .
Comparing both options here , I 'd definitely say that crime pays .
I was born in Thailand and have been living in Samutprakan , which is a small city near Bangkok .
The original sentence `` There are many types of transportation in Thailand . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I often take a motorcycle , a minibus , and finally the BTS .
Bus is a form of transportation that I rarely take .
From my experience ,
Motorcycles are a very convenient form of transportation .
It is the fastest mode of transportation when you are in a rush .
Even though it is needed in a hurry , it should be done carefully .
On the other hand , it is not very safe .
Motorcycles are the most dangerous form of transport in Thailand compared to others .
Even though we have a traffic rule , some riders still keep breaking it .
Continue with the minibus ; there are some rules for this type of transportation .
The drivers have to follow the traffic rules . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I found that it is good transportation , which costs low prices and travels a long distance .
Therefore , people in the low to medium class prefer to use this transport .
People who live around the city usually make an appointment downtown .
Because of a heavy traffic jam in Bangkok , they try to avoid other services .
Then , BTS is the best option .
It is very satisfying in terms of time and convenience .
People can manage their time more easily because BTS is fixed in time .
Therefore , this transport is the most predictable .
Thailand is a country that is not strict about the rules .
Therefore , news about accidents in the country can be heard .
Customers and drivers are not disciplined .
My suggestion for addressing the problems above is to start showing people the importance of regulations .
Drivers , customers , and even the police officers should cooperate .
Dear Mrs. Kate Ashby ,
I am studying English at Esosel , entering level 3 in the college , and I can speak English very well .
I would like to work with people , and I can speak many languages , so I communicate well with others .
I would like to work long hours on weekends because on weekdays I go to college , and I am happy to work long hours on weekends .
It looks like you provided a blank sentence . Could you please provide the sentence you would like corrected ?
Humanity witnessed one of recorded history 's most incredible minds at work when Albert Einstein came onto the scene .
Although his theory ( his and his wife 's ) was basically scientific in nature , it can and has been applied to all areas of human existence .
The original sentence is already correct : `` The theory I 'm speaking of is relativity .
With this theory also came the field of quantum mechanics .
It is difficult to condense this topic , a topic which has volumes of literature .
The original sentence `` Personally , I find that relativity has n't had its full impact . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
This is probably for several reasons : first , the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are in reference to that point of departure is rather abstract .
It seems impossible , and it leaves humans grasping for closure .
What Einstein did to humanity 's philosophy was change the notion that closure could be obtained .
The Socratic idea that all was known .
Corrected sentence : And it was only a matter of time before a `` moment '' would reveal that the knowledge from `` within '' was , in effect , shattered .
The philosopher 's stone was pulverized into utopic and nostalgic dust .
Since it is my socialization that leads me to have a notion of earth time [ 24 hours = day ] , I think Einstein reconstructed part of it .
Although I do n't claim to understand relativity , I 've attempted to delve into the topic [ like Sidphantha and his rock ] .
The point is , my notion of time has changed ; and I think once humanity realizes that time notions are human constructions and are subject to change , then the impact of Einstein 's idea will be felt .
For now , we are left with a world that has used Einstein 's `` invention '' for intentions not worthy of the genius , namely atomic bombs .
The significance of atomic bombs can not be overstated when speaking about humanity in the 20th century .
Corrected sentence : It set up a whole network of global systems .
The USA and USSR , with Japan and Germany as the `` winners .
Cold wars : North-South relations .
Many things have been generated , namely fear !
Relatively speaking , fear has been the main point of departure for the construction of the global community .
This is a point that I think needs to be changed from fear to peace .
A shift in focus , if you will .
Some would say this is too utopian .
But if humanity sought to understand relativity ( as does Stephen Hawking ) , our notions would be radically changed .
For now , we must deal with the shortcomings of humanity 's use of Einstein 's ideas : atomic weapons .
Yesterday , I went to a basketball club . In my first training , I scored 4 baskets .
It was the first time for me to play basketball .
The original sentence `` I think I was very good . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
My dream is to be a basketball player . Playing basketball is really fun and nice .
I loved playing it . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I want to play it again .
It is undeniable that animals are vital to medical research for its many benefits .
Researchers could use animals , such as mice and monkeys , to examine the new drugs .
Furthermore , animals were probably used to determine the amount of dosage .
These usages certainly identify whether the vaccine is functional .
In addition , it defines the maximum dosage beyond which the drug becomes lethal .
Also , one of the main purposes of using an animal in a lab is that the antidote for its bite , for instance , snakes , has to be extracted from their body .
Even a bite could kill a person if the suitable antidote were not available .
Writing about my favorite sport is discussing one of the best things in my life , since I 'm a sports fan and have been so all through my life .
While I was in high school , I still recall dreading the moment I had to go to gym class , but somehow later in life , I discovered that sports would not just save my life .
Furthermore , it became one of my favorite pastimes .
No matter what my mood was , putting on my trainers and finding a new place to discover ... possibilities became endless : parks , the beach , running tracks .
Getting lost in the middle of the woods ... anytime , anyplace .
Then , one thing led to another , and starting activities like rollerblading , cycling , skiing , or just going to the gym on rainy days totally changed my mood .
Little did I know at that time that I would meet the man of my life thanks to sports . The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
To conclude , I would like to leave a message to all those young people out there who do n't seem to fit anywhere .
Taking part in any free-time activity will help you become a better person .
You will learn to share , to compete , and to lead a healthier life .
Believe that the potential lies deep within you and that the sky is the limit . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
As stated in the book `` Say it Again , See it Again , '' artistic research is quite a complicated and frequently discussed topic .
In academic fields , there is some question of how artistic research relates to research within an academic framework .
When we look it up in the dictionaries to find out what research in academic study is , we read this definition :
The systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions '' is a definition , so it should be enclosed in quotation marks and followed by a period . However , if you are looking to correct it as a standalone sentence , it would be : The systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions .
According to the UNESCO definition , research is `` any creative and systematic activity undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge , including knowledge of man , culture , and society , and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications .
Another source said that research involves searching for and gathering information , usually to answer a particular question or problem .
When we look for artistic research .
It is said that artistic research is the process of making artwork .
Those two terms , academic research and artistic research , mainly differ by the result of the research .
In the academic field , after research , we have some knowledge that can be generalized .
A conclusion of the academic research becomes a law that endures over time .
While in artistic research , we work with singular knowledge that is unique .
And it can not really remain as a law or a long-term statement . Because of the experimental nature of the research , its unpredictable , multidisciplinary , and creative character , it is difficult to define what artistic research really is .
Also , artistic research does not produce only knowledge .
It changes people 's mindset .
Artistic research is a form of research because artists seek knowledge in order to create an artwork .
Corrected sentence : So in art , research exists in the artwork itself .
I have read in the book about artistic research that artists are doing their research without calling it research .
Mrs. Kate Ashby ,
I would like to apply for a weekend job at Green Pepper Cafe .
I am a twenty-one-year-old student .
Food is the most important part of my life ; it makes me happy .
I really like to cook different kinds of dishes from all over the world for my friends .
I am used to working long hours because last holiday I had a full-time job in a bar at the beach .
I am an open-minded and cheerful person who loves to meet new people and learn new things .
I think that I am a calm and friendly person ; for me , a satisfied client is a happy client .
I also know Spanish , which could be helpful to talk with tourists from Spain .
I hope you would like to meet with me and get to know more about my experience in working in bars and cafes .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
With kind regards , Clarita
Watching `` Cuéntame '' might not be the first show you think of when considering the Spanish last century , but in fact , it is a good example of our country 's history at that time .
Although it was shot last year by a young director , he knew how difficult life was , so it is more than likely he studied in detail the society , customs , clothes , or hair trends because the elders say it is a true reflection of Spanish life .
Even more , it is said by pensioners that the movie reminds them of their younger days , so it is a realistic film .
On the other hand , it is more than likely that they could be a bit sad , homesick , and maybe they could shed a tear too .
The movie would reflect the life of an average family with a toddler , two teenage children , and the grandmother , who is always wearing black clothes because she lost her husband in the Spanish Civil War .
As the parents were working , she used to do the housework and take care of her grandchildren .
On top of that , it shows the beginning of the democratic age and how difficult the birth of some political parties was . Of course , it also shows us how women began to smoke , wear skinny trousers , and get their driving licenses .
It was a strange change in this country .
To sum up , I strongly recommend this movie not only for students or young people but also for middle-aged and older individuals . In addition , it could be a great movie for foreigners , as it would help them easily understand our history .
Dear Mrs. Ashby ,
I would like to work in the café on the weekend .
I have worked at a cafe many times before and enjoy meeting people . I have visited Green Pepper Cafe many times and drink coffee there .
It was very good , and the people working there were happy .
I want to work at your place as I am interested in many foods and I really enjoy meeting people .
I also work long hours in a cafe , which I like .
Please tell me soon if I have an interview .
Schooling of the children
I think children must be educated at school , not at home .
Because at school they can interact with other people , learning from a young age how to handle different situations , understand diverse thoughts and cultures , and learn from these experiences .
Knowledge is not just what we learn sitting on a chair , but also how to deal with society .
It does n't make any sense for a person to be very smart , intelligent , and knowledgeable about many subjects if they ca n't express themselves or their ideas .
If he can not act naturally when facing difficulties or stay calm when dealing with others ' thoughts that differ from his ideas , it demonstrates a lack of flexibility in handling challenging situations .
The knowledge is a combination of the intellectual and emotional parts of our brain .
It must be a balance between these two parts .
Teaching the child alone at home is not a good idea for his development .
The advantage of teaching the child at home is being able to see and follow exactly what they will learn , the time spent studying , and closely observing what the child is assimilating .
But , like I said before , it 's very important to help them deal with other people and situations from a young age , to combine the rational and emotional parts of their brains .
It 's a hard decision for parents , especially for those who want to control all aspects of their children 's lives , but it 's necessary to understand how important a decision like that is for the future of those kids .
It 's more important to keep control of everything or let the child learn from his experiences and develop other skills .
Corrected sentence : I like and really love football .
I do n't know why ; I just love that . My favorite club is Real Madrid , and my favorite football players are Kaká and CR7 .
I do n't care ; I 'll watch my favorite club 's match every time .
Through football , I can see him .
He 's my favorite player , more favorite than Kaka .
If I can watch his competition , I 'll watch it .
He 's my spirit animal also .
I have loved football since I was in the 1st grade of junior high school . Usually , I watched football matches with my father .
At midnight , we were watching together ...
My lovely team is my Country Garuda Team ; you 're the best in the world .
My hope is that the national football team of Indonesia could become a big team and the best team .
This idea is completely erroneous.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Money , perhaps , is a necessary evil in order to conduct the daily affairs of life .
Money , in some form or other , is required in order to carry out business , trading , commerce , and exchange of property .
Money enables a human being to store what they own , to pay their expenses , to share with others , or even to give to those in need .
However , it is true that the love of money is the root of all evil .
This is a different concept altogether .
The desire for what we may not have can , at times , cause people to conduct themselves in a way that they might not otherwise .
Although there is a healthy desire to meet the needs that we have , at times , this desire can be pushed to an extreme .
How many times have we seen on the evening news a family being broken apart , a company going under , or even a nation crumbling simply because there was a desperate desire , on the part of one or many , for something that exceeded what was actually needed or required ?
Even individuals who are in constant search of what evades them can be destroyed .
They think that having the `` right '' car , living in the `` right '' neighborhood , or knowing the `` right '' people can bring them happiness or contentment .
This love of money urges them on , causes them to neglect their families , and at times leads them to commit crimes for which they are imprisoned .
Our society pays dearly , both financially and socially , for its love affair with money .
It is a cross-cultural thing .
We could be speaking of the American dollar , the Japanese yen , or the Spanish peseta .
The love of whatever represents the financial exchange between parties wreaks havoc in a nation , a family , and even an individual 's life .
Not the money itself , but rather the love of it , persuades men 's hearts , captivates their minds , and influences their priorities and their behavior .
The hoarding of wealth for personal benefit or security , when pushed to an extreme , is the root of all evil .
The original sentence `` It produces selfishness in even the smallest child . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
It 's not long before a 4- to 5-year-old realizes the power that money brings .
He begins to hide it , save it , ask for it , and spend it .
A healthy thing can be turned into a tool for disaster . Is money the root of all evil ?
The sentence `` No . '' is already correct as a standalone response or statement . If you intended to expand it into a complete sentence , you could provide more context or details . For example : Original sentence : No . Corrected sentence : No , I do not agree with that statement.However , if `` No . '' is meant to be a brief and direct answer , it does not require correction .
It can be used for good .
It can bring relief to those in need and even extra joy into a life that already has its needs met .
However , the love of it , the overwhelming desire for it that causes people to overlook what is most important and at times even commit terrible acts toward each other , is truly the root of all evil .
History is the identity of people . It can tell future generations about the past .
As all nations and people have their own history , it is important to distinguish this only by the marks left .
Corrected sentence : Historical places , as well as archives , are the most common things that show ancient life .
The original sentence `` Every nation has its identity . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
In my country , there are a lot of historical places that refer to different civilizations .
But the place that attracts the most people is the capital ; we can call it the crossroads of civilization .
Different civilizations , from Byzantine to French , including Ottoman and others , have established themselves there .
Our attractive historical palace is in CASBAH .
CASBAH is a historical city and has an important story about its construction .
I believe I am a good candidate for the summer camp staff .
Besides raising two children , most children are very fond of me .

Dear Isabel ,
My new town is wonderful .
I really enjoy living here !
My town is near a lake and between two bigger towns .
The main attractions are a historical museum and a very large indoor bath .
My favourite place in town is a bench by the lake .
The original sentence `` I love to sit there and watch the sunrise . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Best wishes from my lovely new home .
I live in a tiny village named Fals , where there are n't many people ; there are only , more or less , one hundred people .
In my little village , most people are farmers , and they do n't use too many cars or motorbikes ; they just use trucks and other vehicles .
So , I think that in my village , we take care of the environment because we do n't produce a lot of pollution . Therefore , I can say that I live in a village that is healthy in terms of pollution .
But in my country , we usually do n't take care of the environment because people in Spain do n't think of others ; they just think about themselves .
Although most of the Spanish people do n't think about the environment because they say it 's not the present , it 's the future .
Childhood nowadays is really involved with technology .
Most of the fun for children comes from video games , television , computers , and tablets , where they play electronic games and watch movies or cartoons .
In this way , it is clear that television entertains and is part of our lives , but it can also educate if it has appropriate subjects .
For example , some cartoons with their characters can teach children to count in other languages , solve mathematical problems such as simple addition , and most importantly , children can learn how to interact with their parents and friends and understand what is wrong or right . In other words , television can influence their behavior .
On the other hand , on television , there are many advertisements which can affect a child 's choices and desires , such as wanting a particular toy , and soon they start asking for it just because of the media .
Therefore , it is very important that parents have knowledge about what their children are watching and learning on TV .
Thus , television could be good for education , but the time in front of the screen has to be controlled ; after all , childhood is also constructed by playing in the open air !
It is apparently due to the huge improvement in the automobile industry , which creates a better transportation environment with dramatic advancements .
You can easily travel from point A to point B by stepping into a private car , which will create an electronic delivery lane and compress the data of the car with the driver .
Drivers simply ignite the car engine , choose the destination with the accurate address , map the three-dimensional street view , and then drive .
In only five minutes , literally , you 'll arrive .
With the new way of driving , people do not have to walk through a 500-meter road to public transportation , like train stations or bus stations , while buying modern cars that provide a better transport experience .

No doubt all of us dream of living in a healthy environment , which requires a lot from both the people and the government .
But in fact , this does not happen 100 % of the time , as most people do not comply with this ; they often leave rubbish in the streets instead of placing it in the designated areas .
In the village , the farmers always throw the tailings and the dead bodies of animals into the canals , which dirties the water they use for watering the farmlands , leading to the pollution of the food .
As a matter of fact , there is an enormous quantity of ways to transmit information , which has always been extremely important for people , especially nowadays .
We can receive it from old-fashioned or traditional sources of information , such as books , as well as from contemporary types of media , for instance , TVs and radio .
Due to the fact that all kinds of sources have advantages and disadvantages , some arguments will be considered to find the most effective one .
Actually , broadcasting activities are great opportunities to get the latest news about a situation in the world or the latest knowledge about different fields of science , whereas books can present obsolete or inadequate information .
Indeed , scientists have proved that about half of the information in books becomes outdated in 5 to 10 years .
In contrast , we can find that some data on television and on the radio are deliberately distorted .
Nowadays , there is an opinion that the media is the fourth estate , which can influence our consciousness .
It is hard to disagree with it when information becomes a means of warfare rather than a method of enlightenment .
Then books come to the forefront as a means of understanding history : all human experience , accumulated over the entire span of human existence , is represented there .
In conclusion , I guess that we should not choose only one way of communicating information , as all types of media have pros and cons .
Choosing the appropriate option for receiving certain data is a skill we should learn .
Every year , there 's a winter festival in my city .
This year , there were more activities than last year .
It was a great time spent with my friends .
There were a lot of activities like snowboarding , competitions , and concerts .
There was a lovely activity for the kids called `` Do you wan na build a snowman ? '' where they spent an incredible time building snowmen .
I participated in a dance competition .
The judges said that I was an amazing dancer , and it was a very emotional moment for me .
I ca n't wait for the festival next year .
Football is my favorite game because it is quite challenging and interesting . I began to play football when I was 6 years old .

Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to you to apply for the job you advertised in Summer Holidays Magazine as a volunteer at USA summer camps .
I am 23 years old , and I have just finished my studies in Teaching at the University of Seville .
After summer , I would like to work at a prestigious centre in Birmingham , 'The Good Shepherd School ' , so learning from a summer camp in the United States of America would be a great opportunity for me .
As you can see from my attached Curriculum Vitae , I have been working as a nanny for two years , and I also have five little cousins whom I have had to look after on many occasions .
In addition , I worked at summer camps last summer , where I was in charge of planning and leading games and craft activities .
Being a leader made me develop a strong sense of responsibility .
In addition , I am about to sit for the CAE ( Certificate in Advanced English ) in a few weeks .
I love learning English ; in fact , I have some English exchange partners whom I talk to twice a week .
I believe a good teacher is someone who can entertain children , play with them , and teach them how to improve their skills .
I think I have all these abilities , and I am perfectly capable of doing this job .
I look forward to hearing from you .

There are several reasons why people in the UK might stop eating beef .
For example , everyone may suddenly become vegetarian , or tastes may alter in such a way that nobody in the UK wants to eat beef .
However , these occurrences are , at best , unlikely .
The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease eating beef is the disease CJD .
This disease is the human equivalent of `` mad cow disease '' or BSE .
In recent years , there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE .
This seems to have been mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago .
In the 1960s and 1970s , cows were given feed that included sheep ( and their brains ) in its ingredients .
Many animals that ate this feed developed BSE , and even more passed it on to their young .
There is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous , as they believe that BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef .
There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
However , cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media , and this has greatly influenced people .
Pictures on the television of cows with BSE , who are unable to walk properly , and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is .
If the media coverage of CJD and BSE continues in the same manner , it is not inconceivable that people in the UK might become so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely .
If people in the UK were to cease to eat beef , the effect on the agricultural industry would be devastating .
Cow farmers would decrease in numbers significantly .
This is because , with the beef market destroyed , the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market , which is not large enough to sustain many sellers .
The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products , and if this happened , cow farmers would cease to exist entirely .
However , when people cease to eat beef , what do they eat instead ?
The answer is pork , lamb , and other meats .
The increase in demand for the other meats would be approximately proportional to the fall in demand for beef .
This would mean that producers of other meats would benefit from people ceasing to eat beef .
Although cattle farmers could no longer remain in the beef market , they could switch from cattle farming to pig or sheep farming and stay in the agricultural industry .
The overall effect on the size of the agricultural industry would be virtually nil.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
This is because the fall in the size of the beef market would correspond with a rise in the size of other agricultural product markets .
This would mean that the structure of the agricultural industry had altered greatly , with the proportion of it taken up by markets for meats other than beef growing .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing with reference to your advertisement , which I saw in the magazine two weeks ago . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I am very interested in this vacancy .
I am the president of the Young Pioneers Club at a primary school , so I usually organize picnics , camping trips , sports , and other outdoor activities for the students .
In order to ensure safety for them , my school sometimes asks me to attend some first-aid courses , which give me the confidence to deal with emergency situations .
Particularly , I am free from June to September .
I am a native speaker of Vietnamese , and I was awarded a B grade in the First Certificate in English last year .
I consider myself to be energetic , humorous , enthusiastic , and sociable .
I would do my best to make a success of this job , and I hope you will consider my application favorably . I have enclosed my CV for your review , and I would also be glad to attend an interview at any time convenient for you .
The sentence `` Yours faithfully , '' is already correct and does not require any changes . It is a standard closing for a formal letter when the recipient 's name is not known .
Please provide the sentence you would like corrected , and I will help you with it .
Dear David ,
I 'm Paloma , your new pen pal friend ! I come from an island called Cozumel . I like sports and hanging out with my friends .
What did you do on vacation ?
I went to Cancún , visited museums , and stayed in Xpu-ha , a really beautiful beach . We stayed in an apartment near it .
There , I saw a lot of tourists who were almost crying because they ate chili . I laughed a lot , as did my friends . Do not underestimate the power of chili .
Do you have brothers or sisters ? I have two little ones , one who is 11 years old and the other who is 7 .
I have seven pets : 1 parrot , 2 dogs , 2 hamsters , and 2 turtles . I think it 's a little more than normal .
I am looking forward to receiving your letter !
A hug .
It seems like the sentence `` Paloma '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or additional information so I can help you correct or complete it ?

Dear Mrs. Benson ,
I am writing to apply for a job at your international bookshop , which was advertised in the `` London '' newspaper last week .
I am 35 years old and from Spain , but I am studying Literature in London .
At the moment , I am looking for a job to spend the summer working .
I like reading books in other languages because I speak Spanish , English , and French fluently .
I have experience in this area because I worked in another bookshop with temporary jobs last summer .
I would welcome the opportunity to spend the summer working in your international bookshop.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .

Interestingly enough , this topic is one that is very important to me . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I often dwell on the characteristics of mankind that lead us to continually invent new things.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
We seem to be somewhat obsessed with technology and using it to dominate nature , as well as our fellow man .
Technology and inventions seem to stem from our natural fear of death and our human insecurities.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . However , if you want to make a minor stylistic adjustment , you could simplify it slightly : '' We attempt to dominate nature to live without fearing death , and we attempt to dominate others to live without our petty insecurities .
For these reasons , I would argue that the only inventions of the twentieth century that have significantly changed people 's lives for the better are those that have occurred in the medical field .
Although these inventions do stem from a fear of death , they do not attempt to dominate nature or other human beings as the majority of other inventions do .
The original sentence `` They save lives . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
By closely analyzing the nature of modern inventions , one notes a consistent trend leading away from a lifestyle that is peacefully coexistent with nature . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
We are ourselves a part of nature , yet we attempt to live outside of it . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
We continue to destroy the plants , animals , and the earth itself , and our new inventions help us to do it in more efficient ways .
Therefore , inventions in the 20th century have had , for the most part , a negative effect on our lives because by destroying nature , we 're destroying ourselves .
In addition , our inventions are used to dominate one another . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
We invent better weapons and better economic systems geared towards killing and depriving other people .
Medical inventions , on the other hand , are designed to help people of all colors and can not be used to dominate nature or other people .
They are one of the only truly `` kind '' expressions of mankind 's creativity .
In modern society , especially in developed countries , traffic and all the problems related to it affect the socioeconomic conditions of the entire population .
Many governments argue that these problems could be solved by increasing the cost of petrol . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
To my mind , this should not be the right way to solve them , and other measures need to be carried out .
In many overcrowded cities , like New York and Tokyo , the primary cause of air pollution is the chaotic and uncontrolled flow of vehicles that use fossil fuels to operate .
This trend will certainly rise in the future due to the great number of people who are moving from the countryside to the city .
This phenomenon happens especially in developing countries such as China .
However , an increase in fuel prices is not effective in reducing traffic flow .
Indeed , over the last fifty years , this price has shown a dramatic increase , but air pollution continues to rise .
It can be seen in some virtuous towns , for instance , Oslo in Norway , that encouraging people to use bicycles is an excellent way to reduce traffic and its consequences .
The said encouragement can be carried out by a decrease in taxes or other monetary benefits for those who ride their bikes instead of driving a car .
Another way to reduce traffic is the enhancement of the public transport system , such as larger trains , more bus lines , etc .
In fact , many people prefer to travel by car because the trains are often overcrowded or due to the fact that they have to wake up early in the morning to catch the bus .
In conclusion , although increasing the price of petrol could be effective in the short term , this measure can not reduce the use of fossil fuels and , therefore , the problems related to traffic .
However , better solutions can be found by making people aware of the benefits of reducing car use .
Good morning ,
Last week I traveled by air with your airline . The trip was good , but I lost my luggage .
It is big , fluorescent pink with blue lines .
I went to the staff to tell them about this situation , and they told me to send an email to the company .
So I 'm writing to receive my luggage .
I hope that you can find it because it contains things that are very important to me .
Please write to me soon !
It seems like the sentence `` Noemi '' is incomplete . Could you please provide more context or the full sentence so I can help you with the correction ?
I 'm very pleased that you have taken it into account .
I 'm an Italian girl , I 'm nineteen years old , and I live with my parents and my twin siblings in the south of Italy .
When I was a baby , I used to go to summer camps with my family . I grew up in a camp .
I think that I can be a suitable person for this job because I currently look after my brothers , who are five years old , and I love cooking and playing with them . I grew up in the south , where there are many summer camps , and I usually work at those , so I have experience .
Hoping to have satisfied your requests , I 'm waiting for your answer .
The people living in my town are not very environmentally friendly .
They are not minded that way .
For example , when it is time to take the rubbish out , the town hall sets a specific time for this task .
Corrected sentence : Instead , the citizens choose not to do it during this time , but at any other time they feel like .
I do n't think this is a very proper thing to do .
My teacher asked me what I do in my free time .
I always enjoy playing video games , and I usually do it at night .
I do it at night because in the afternoon I study ; I enjoy doing it .
I hang out regularly with my friends , and we enjoy it a lot .
The original sentence `` I think I am a privileged teenager . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
In the past , people used public transport more frequently than they do now .
In my opinion , very few people will use it in the future , and maybe no one will .
To start with , all people will prefer using cars to using public transport .
This is because when people use public transport , it tires them from standing and waiting for a long time in a crowd .
Also , having their own car will help them go easily to any place they want without standing and waiting to find public transport to take them .
Furthermore , bikes and walking will replace public transportation .
This is because people now care for themselves and their health .
So , they prefer using bikes to using cars or public transportation for their health and to save the environment from pollution .
Moreover , in the future , public transportation may be banned to avoid the real harm of its toxic fumes .
Besides , it harms the environment , and this can cause acid rain and global warming .
To conclude , public transport is not useful anymore .
I believe that they will end because their harms are far greater than their benefits .
Drinking has been a custom in the U.S. for many decades .
Ever since the Wild West , the Civil War , and the drafting of the Declaration of Independence ,
People under the age of twenty-one are considered to be minors when it comes to drinking alcoholic beverages in the United States .
At eighteen , you are considered a man ; therefore , you should be able to decide your own fate and make your own decisions .
Eighteen should be the legal age to consume alcohol in the United States . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
You can be conscripted to go to war in the United States at the age of eighteen , but you can not drink a beer like all of the other adults over the age of twenty-one .
Kids are dying for our country in wars , but the government will still not allow them to drink .
How can you think you are a man and fight in combat when the government says that you are too young to do what all of the other adults do ?
I think if you can hold a gun and fight for your country , you should be able to feel the effects of drinking alcohol .
Kids are getting into too much trouble trying to hide their drinking from their parents .
Most kids aged eighteen to twenty are out of high school , and their parents do not care what they do .
A high school diploma should indicate that you are old enough to make mature decisions .
You can say that some kids who are eighteen and over do not have a diploma .
You can make a rule that if you do not have a diploma and you are under twenty-one , then you are not allowed to drink .
Maybe a higher percentage of teenagers will graduate , thinking that if they have a diploma , they will be able to do anything an adult can do .
There would be less crime in the United States among teenagers if eighteen-year-olds were allowed to drink .
Most crimes committed by teenagers involve drinking and driving .
They are left with this decision to drink and drive because they are trying to hide it from their parents .
They can not drink in their own household , so they have to do it somewhere their parents will not find out .
Eighteen-year-olds would not be put in jail for possessing alcohol in the car either , which is another high-percentage crime among teenagers .
Drinking should be prohibited to kids under eighteen .
If the government passed a law allowing them to drink , it would just make the U.S. a better environment to live in .
If anything , the military should convince the government to pass a law allowing teenagers to drink .
If they pass that law , I will feel more like an adult and accept more responsibility because I am one .
The invention of the airplane , in my opinion , has drastically changed the lives of many people . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Air transportation allows people to travel from place to place more quickly and efficiently , and overseas travel has been drastically affected .
Without the airplane , my trip from the U.S. to Spain would 've taken an extraordinary amount of time , maybe a week .
The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely vacation travel ; business , entertainment , and intercontinental relations ( politics ) have also felt the impact of the airplane .
As I 've already said , the area of travel has been greatly improved due to the airplane .
Travel times have been significantly shortened ; for example , driving from Michigan to California takes about 30 to 35 hours , but flying the same distance takes about 3 hours .
This allows people a greater variety of places to travel , and they can spend their vacation time at their chosen destination , not trying to get there .
The business world has definitely flourished due to the airplane . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
As a result of the greatly decreased travel times , countries can work together much more easily than was previously possible .
The original sentence `` Also , business relations within a country have improved . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Today , it is relatively easy for an American businessperson to establish business relations in any part of the world .
I have seen this in the increase in international business during the past few decades .
Entertainment , a very large field , has grown with the invention of the airplane .
Now , entertainers , whether they be musicians , actors , or athletes , can travel from place to place much more quickly .
For example , Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid , which was made much easier because of the airplane .
Professional athletic teams reduce travel time and are able to play more games in many different places because travel is so easy .
The last area I 'm going to touch on is intercontinental relations . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
This area has been positively and negatively affected .
Positive aspects are those such as `` Peace Talks '' between nations ; these would not take place as often as they do if it took the President one week to get to where they were going .
Also , heads of state can more easily interact with each other ( in their respective countries ) with the use of air transportation .
The original sentence `` There are negative aspects , too . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Unfortunately , airplanes have been used in wars .
Japan bombed Pearl Harbor , for example , and the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Japan .
The invention of the airplane has had many positive effects ; unfortunately , however , it has brought about some negative changes as well .
Nowadays , the number of cars is increasing , and the amount of public transport is decreasing .
There are many pros and cons to using cars .
First of all , it is very useful .
You can drive anywhere and anytime . Secondly , it is more economical .
There is an opinion that in any job , discipline should prevail over talent .
To my mind , I would not even question the statement .
Firstly , only regular , constant self-development ( which requires great discipline ) can turn a talent into a perfect skill in different professions .
Any talent is nothing without discipline .
It is common knowledge that even the most gifted and talented musicians or ballet dancers , for example , never succeed without consistent hard work .
Even ballet dancers are famous for their strict discipline . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Secondly , even if a person does not have any evident innate abilities , he or she can develop perfect skills ( provided there is discipline ) and become more impressive than a disorderly talent .
To add to this , the last World Hockey Championship showed how weak our Russian team ( stuffed with brilliant players ) was against the less talented but more disciplined American team .
However , not all people share my thoughts . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
They say if you are a genuine talent , discipline is unimportant because you already have talent , and it is enough .
They also believe that talent is the only thing that matters in artistic professions , and if you are not gifted , no discipline will help you .
I am afraid I can not agree with these people , as I think discipline is more important than talent because talent alone is never enough ; it needs support and day-by-day development .
As for creative professions , Pierre Cardin says that discipline and patience are in first place for him .
I guess we can trust him .
To sum it up , you see , the problem is twofold and is a complicated one , but I still feel that discipline is the leading characteristic in any occupation .
Well , my first impression is that I absolutely disagree with the statement , because in my mind , public transport is much more convenient than cars or most other methods of travel , except walking or cycling .
The reason is simple .
Traveling represents energy , so if you must spend energy , it is more economical and environmentally friendly if you can transport many people with the same energy .
Also , you can use better energy sources with much better efficiency in public transport than in personal cars ( such as electricity from solar or wind devices ) , and then your level of greenhouse gas emissions may be reduced by a significant percentage .
On the other hand , you have a lack of comfort or worse availability for any displacement you need , but the advantages of public transport over private transport are more significant than the disadvantages .
There were many objections raised against the introduction of the National Lottery when the idea was first proposed.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
The main issue raised was the unemployment that would occur in the pool company industry .
As the Lottery would sound more appealing due to the larger winnings , greater public interest , and the fact that it is easier to fill in than a pools coupon , fewer people would do the pools coupon , and this decrease in demand would mean that pools companies such as Littlewoods and Vernon would be forced to make employees redundant due to a decrease in profits .
There were also problems raised about addiction and people younger than sixteen obtaining numbers . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
When the National Lottery was introduced , along with the scratch cards , many people became addicted to buying them . Most of these people were unemployed or poorly paid , and the Lottery represented a source of hope for future wealth . For many , this was not the case , and addiction led to large debts or resorting to violence and stealing to obtain extra money . It was argued that this addiction is on a par with drug addiction and just as hard to kick .
It was also argued that many people under the age of sixteen would buy lottery cards , encouraging the whole nation and its youth to become compulsive gamblers , when money could be better spent on other products , for instance , on extra food for the family , or saving for a holiday or a car .
There were also objections raised to the amount of money the proposed jackpot was to be each week , and the idea of rollovers increasing this figure even more .
Many people argued that the general public would not be able to cope with becoming overnight multi-millionaires , and the untold pressure of fame on the front pages of a tabloid and the influx of begging letters would make many people crack . They would never lead a normal life again and would lose many friends .
Finally , the lottery was thought to put less money into charity collection boxes , as everyone would prefer to put their last pound on a lottery card rather than in a collection box .
Despite this , after a year of the National Lottery , there are many cases put forward for retaining it .
The main issue is the amount of money that goes towards research charities . This was not the case at the start but was introduced later . Additionally , grants are given out to preserve our country 's great heritage and culture , such as extensive work to repair an existing art gallery .
Also , many sporting projects receive grants to build more recreational areas for the youth and public to express themselves , get them off the street , and discipline them .
Another case for retaining it is the fact that people are still prepared to buy a ticket , and if the demand for a ticket is there , there is no reason why the supply should not be as well .
It gives people hope and something to look forward to during the week.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
It has also increased the profits of many newsagents throughout the country , as they get a small percentage of the money for each ticket sold .
There has been a literal explosion of inventions during the twentieth century , ranging from the garbage disposal to the A-bomb .
Some were created to make our lives easier , others to make our lives longer ; all were created for the purpose of advancing civilization .
While each one of these inventions has affected our lives in one way or another , some stand out as having more significantly changed our mode of living .
Perhaps one does stand out a little more among its competition ; that is the television .
Before the late 1940s , entertainment , news , and information virtually all came through newspapers and radio .
A system that seemed to work , many households throughout the nation owned or had access to a radio and/or newspaper , where they could get the day 's information easily and completely .
And , in the case of the radio , everything was almost immediate .
Description of sporting events , voices acting out stories , and government officials speaking directly to the people—the radio seemed the perfect solution for countries with citizens living at all ends of their borders .
The advent of television changed all of that , however , giving the public a `` peek '' at what radio was n't able to give them .
Along with the news and information the radio brought to the homes of the people of the world , the television was able to add images—pictures that enhanced the entire absorption of what was being broadcast .
Where once a reporter 's voice described a scene , now people could see for themselves what was happening because , for the most part , it was happening in front of their eyes .
Besides the obvious higher level of enjoyment television watching may bring its viewer , the most important aspect of this creation is its ability to bring the world together .
A president of one country can be seen and heard in a country far away , giving his views and ideas so that all can `` understand '' him .
The small-town store owner can watch her son in his Olympic race as it 's happening without spending thousands to travel to see him in person .
The examples could be endless . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The strength of television must be realized , however , as it does have the power to reach so many and persuade even more .
It is a multimillion-dollar business that has developed into even more facets of media , which have become a significant part of our lives .
It is a power we should be thankful to control , as long as we do just that : control it .
We can make television work for us in medicine , politics , education , and so much more , so it is necessary to remember to keep the vision in television .
In Brazil , the place where I have lived since I was born , we have a culture of practicing soccer .
In my country , soccer is preferred by almost everyone .
Today , my country is hosting the FIFA World Cup .
It 's the second time Brazil has hosted the World Cup event .
Last time was in 1950 , when Brazil lost the final to Uruguay in a full Maracanã .
Millions of people expect Brazil to win the World Cup . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Environmental problems
What will the future be like in 30 years ' time ?
We think that the planet will be in very bad condition , and the trees will be disappearing in 20 or 30 years due to deforestation . Humans will be having more wars because water will be disappearing .
After that , the poles will have melted completely because the temperature of the sun will become extremely high , causing some people to die from diseases such as cancer .
The air pollution will be extreme because the cars will be flying through the streets , and the technology will have totally changed .
Also , in 20 years , we 'll be eating more fast food , and our anatomy will have changed .
So ... before all this becomes serious , we must begin to take care of our beautiful world .
For sure , traveling by car is more convenient , but I do n't agree with the statement that there is no future for public transport . There are many reasons for this . First of all , cost-wise , public transport is often more economical . Secondly , the population requires more unification than before to reduce environmental damage and save our planet . Additionally , public transportation enhances the chance to build good relationships among people . We need to improve the vehicles that provide these services , such as buses and trains , and their stations .
Dear TOEFL Staff , I am writing about your email concerning my TOEFL IBT Test .
I decided to take the TOEFL IBT Test to apply to Copenhagen University and indicated the U.K. only as an option , but it is not my first choice .
Can I take the test anyway , or do I have to cancel my reservation ?
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Abortion is a controversial topic in today 's society . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Almost everyone has an opinion on the subject .
Many people believe it should be illegal .
Many others believe the government should not interfere ; it should remain the choice of the individual .
Hapeo , poverty , personal choice , and illegal abortions are examples of why people should maintain their right to decide .
Abortion is the right of the people , and it should remain so .
One in four women experiences rape or attempted rape in their lifetime .
Imagine being forced to carry the child of a man who assaulted you and then being forced to give birth to this child .
Would you be able to love him or her ?
This traumatic event takes months or years to recover from .
Without the right to an abortion , many of these women would require more time to recover and more counseling than they would already be receiving .
Most unwanted pregnancies occur in poverty-stricken areas of society .
Generally , children born into impoverished environments remain at that socioeconomic level their entire lives .
Lower-income families also tend to have five children on average , while middle- and upper-income families tend to have only two children .
By offering abortion to lower-income people , you are helping to maintain a balance between the number of lower-income families and middle- and upper-income families .
Women deserve the right to have an abortion . They won this right in the case of Roe versus Wade .
This was a landmark victory for pro-choice women across America .
Without this case , women would probably not be able to make the choice today .
No one should be able to decide whether another person should be allowed to have an abortion .
This includes religious people and the government itself , because if they remove this right , who is to say they will not try to remove other rights eventually ?
If abortion were to be outlawed again , would this end the practice ?
Not many women would continue to seek abortions , whether it be by some unsanitary underground `` clinic '' or on their own with some primitive tool like a coat hanger or similar device .
Abortion would still be rampant , but now it would have a much higher mortality rate and it would be more expensive .
Without abortions , where would all the unwanted children go ?
The basic plan would be to put them in adoption homes , but this would cost taxpayers huge sums of money to support .
The average cost to support a child is one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars for eighteen years .
Infant mortality rates would skyrocket also because there would be a higher rate of ignorant and uncaring parents .
The education systems in Iraq and Australia differ significantly .
There is a big difference between Iraq and Australia in terms of their education or study systems , and this stems from the learning styles , as will be shown :
In Iraq , they still prefer the old learning styles , with schools providing basic knowledge based on the curriculum and focusing on homework . In contrast , in Australia , they emphasize indirect education through songs , painting , and storytelling , and they do n't focus on homework because students complete all their tasks at school .
I think the parents in Iraq care more about their children 's results than those in Australia because the level of education in Iraq determines their destiny , as Iraqi people prefer formal jobs over freelance work .
Both Iraqis and Australians believe in the knowledge gained through education , and it is not ...
Hello , my name is Lucio , and I am from Mexico City .
Nowadays , the environment faces problems around the world , especially in my city , as it is one of the biggest cities in the world . Therefore , four years ago , I decided to take action to help save natural resources .
The first thing that I do every day is to put a bucket behind me to collect the water that is wasted , and then it is used to wash the yard .
The second thing that I do is use energy-saving bulbs throughout my house ; with this action , the contamination caused by my house is minimized . The last thing that I do is close the faucet while brushing my teeth .
I can do more in favor of the environment , but at the moment , I am comfortable with the actions that I take every day .
Traveling by motorway today is not as easy as it was meant to be by any standards , yet every morning and evening , motorways across the United Kingdom are blocked solid with traffic to and from work .
Not only is this ecologically unsound , due to the harmful byproducts of the combustion engine , which have been stressed in the press recently , but it is also stressful , time-wasting , and expensive .
Earth has a finite supply of the fossil fuels from which petroleum and diesel for our cars and trains are derived , but we have a need to get to work , which could be anything up to 200 miles away .
Not only are there problems in traveling from A to B , but the likelihood is that if B is any major city , you will waste more time looking for somewhere to park there .
During pre-war Britain , rail was the only means of long-distance travel within the UK , and so the rail system was more efficient , with more frequent trains and many more stations . However , as the motor car became more popular , fewer people used the railroad , and the system declined . The smaller demand has led to less frequent services at an increased price .
In my opinion , the only way forward is the increased use of public transport systems because of the sheer waste caused by the average two-car family .
The majority of the cars that you will see while traveling at a 'snail 's pace ' along the M6 outside Birmingham will be driven by one person with no passengers . If these drivers had offered to give a colleague from work a lift home , the numbers on the road would effectively be halved .
Cities such as Manchester have tried hard to control the increasing numbers of cars by introducing bypasses and providing multi-storey car parking .
Some cities have even banned cars from entering the city during work hours , making pedestrian life enjoyable .
Trams have been reestablished in some cities , allowing people to leave their cars to do their shopping .
This , in my opinion , is the attitude that should be adopted not only by town and city councils but also by the government to reduce the number of cars on the road .
It was like her first day at school . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
She stood before the great building and started searching for a clue that could help her overcome this feeling of uncertainty , desperation , and terrible curiosity that had invaded her .
The original sentence `` What was required of her ? '' is already correct and does not need any changes .
How was she supposed to reach an agreement and establish a settlement with those beings , which looked so much like humans but were not in the least similar to any other person she had ever known ?
They were not animals , they were not machines , they were not automata , but they were ready to use her and leave her empty , with neither soul nor mind .
The original sentence `` She was there to negotiate the end of the war . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
She was alone , and they were millions .
The original sentence `` They had crept unnoticed . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
A whole and soon-to-be-lost civilization was fighting to survive , and their future was in her hands .
They owed her everything , and therefore they had agreed to receive her , but would they listen to her words ?
She knew she would just tell lies , lots of lies , millions of lies , just as there were millions of beings with a reason to fight back : surveillance .
As she climbed the ruined stairs through the debris and filth , there were still some pieces of corpses nearby , and the smell was so disgusting she thought she would puke at any moment .
Her watch showed 13:13 , which was a good hour , as good as any other .
The sun was obscured by a dark rose dust .
In today 's society , it is unrealistic for one to expect to work for a single company or employer for the entirety of their life .
This essay explains this statement from three perspectives : economic , sociological , and legal .
Workers do not gain maximum financial benefits if they work for a single company for a very long time . To attract more competent workers , companies tend to pay more to people who move in from another company .
In Japan , for example , many workers conduct job hunting after spending several years at a company in order to get a better job at another company .
Except for those whose primary motivation to work is not money , one needs to consider working for several companies to achieve a better life .
One will be constantly exposed to degrading opinions from society if they stay at a single company for the entirety of their life : some societies consider people who do not change companies less competent .
Again in Japan , because there is a social norm that competent workers constantly change their jobs in order to get a better job , some people tend to see those who stay at a single company as lacking competence and being less ambitious .
Being very sensitive to how other people see us , we are less likely to work for a single company for a very long time given the current social standards .
Companies gain more benefits if they hire new employees for a short period .
Some countries require a company to hire an individual as a regular worker if they work for a specific number of years .
In Japan , for example , with the intention of securing jobs for the youth , companies are required to hire part-time workers as regular , full-time workers after they have worked for more than four years .
This has been burdening some companies that are hiring only part-time workers for the sake of personnel costs ; as a result , many companies do not renew a work contract for more than four years .
Again , it is unrealistic for a worker to work for a single company for the rest of their life .
Everything happened three years ago . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
His father was very angry with him because Michael was n't the person he used to be .
Michael came back very late one night .
He was going out with people who were a bad influence on him . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
They were drinking every night , and they were out of control .
That day , Michael 's father talked with him and gave him one last opportunity to change .
The original sentence `` At first , Michael was out of control . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
He started yelling at his father and hitting the furniture , so he was unable to hear what his father was saying .
Michael decided to leave because he did n't want to cause any more problems , but it was too late .
If his father had understood why Michael was acting this way , Michael 's father would have punished him severely .
So , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Hi , Isabel !
Where are you now ?
What are you doing at this moment ?
I 'm in Oxford , United Kingdom , with my best friend , and we are visiting the city .
Now this is my new city , and I love it .
Oxford is a fantastic and old city in the UK .
There are many shops of any type .
My favorite shop is Topshop , and I like everything there .
Here there are many interesting universities .
The food is n't good ; I miss the Italian food .
The sentence `` With lovely Ale '' is incomplete and lacks context . To correct it , we need to provide additional information to form a complete sentence . Here is one possible correction : '' With lovely Ale , we enjoyed a delightful evening at the pub . `` This correction assumes `` Ale '' is a person 's name or a type of beverage , and it provides context for the sentence .
Dear Phillip ,
I 've received your letter and will respond as soon as possible .
You seem to be very upset because of these two interests .
I think you should n't give up anything you love .
They may exhaust you and give you no time to take a break .
I had been through this during my high school life , so I could totally understand what you 're thinking .
I would rather give you some advice on how to take advantage of your time .
It 's better to schedule your daily events , which can reduce the time you waste on activities like surfing the Net or watching TV . If you are still tired , try to take a rest .
It 's fine for a time-out but not for giving up .
I 'm pretty sure it will work if you are willing to give it a try .
Cheer up ! I will always be on your side .
Zumba : A Healthy and Fun Sport
If you want to keep fit , you should dance Zumba .
Actually , Zumba is one of the sports that you can find in all gyms .
It is a sport in which people move their entire body as they dance to different kinds of music .
Usually , one session of Zumba lasts around 60 minutes , during which you can burn approximately 600 calories .
Also , you get exercise and , at the same time , you have fun .
Moreover , practicing Zumba is an opportunity to meet other people and make new friends .
It is a sport that everyone can train in : children , women , men ... It is also considered a sport that makes people happy because they learn many difficult dances , see changes in their bodies , look healthy , and thus , their self-esteem improves .
If you do Zumba three times a week and follow a healthy diet , you will lose weight and feel better .
Furthermore , I would like to advise that before each session , you must warm up the muscles to avoid any injury or problem . You have to begin carefully because there are very fast songs , and you can hurt yourself .
Also , you will need a lot of water to drink .
On the other hand , if you feel tired , you can rest for a few songs .
To rest during a song is better than trying to dance to all the songs and ending up injured .
In addition , after each session , you may stretch the body very well , and thus , the next day you wo n't feel the horrible stiffness .
You have to practice Zumba because it is very fun . You will be the king or queen of the discos .
My city does not have good transport .
We only have buses , and the system is not good .
They are late , and there are very many people .
The government should invest a lot of money in the system to improve it .
If the politicians use the money more correctly , the situation will be much better .
Unfortunately , I can not say that my city is really nature-protective .
The city is quite clean , but all the garbage is transported to scrapyards and stored there .
Some of it was burned down , but most of the garbage remains forever .
Well , not forever maybe , but garbage remains with collectors for an indefinite time .
Several years ago in my city , special garbage containers appeared .
These containers have several sections for different types of garbage.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
But when a container became full , the dustcart operator poured all the garbage into the same truck !
So naturally , people were not happy to see that , and in less than a month , all those containers were abandoned .
The next major problem with environmental protection is industrial waste .
There 's a river in our city that is heavily polluted with industrial waste .
Today , all factories have filtering systems , but our river is still off-limits for swimming .
Nevertheless , I 'd like to say that our city is changing .
These changes are not happening quickly , but they are in progress .
I hope that in a couple of years , I 'll be able to say that the city is really clean .
People have always seen themselves as social animals , with living together as the norm .
Family life is one of the outlines of how we understand ourselves and our relationships , but also the way we build our places to live .
In this essay , I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different generations of one family living together in the same house .
In my opinion , there are more advantages , but the worst thing that can happen is the generation gap , which is one of the reasons why relationships between teenagers and parents or grandparents can be difficult sometimes .
On the other hand , there is nothing better than getting on well together , especially with people you can rely on and trust .
They are your family , and you are sharing your time and space with them , so if you feel involved , your life will be easier .
All you need is good communication skills and empathy .
You can help each other when necessary , ask for advice , and be able to take part in reasoned discussions .
Corrected sentence : There are some ways to prevent problems and ways to avoid upsetting each other .
It is important to keep an open mind.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
When we act like that , we will find that all of us not only survive but thrive .
Finally , family living should be nurtured and supported by all family members because unity is our strength .
Good deed .
It was a nice Saturday night in Madrid . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I was at the Plenilunio with my friends , like any 15-year-old adolescent .
When we were leaving the shopping center , I unexpectedly found a really weird handbag , and I was shocked by the situation .
Finding a bag with jewelry is not an ordinary situation .
When I took the bag to see if there was any document or something that could help me find the owner , my friends were turning a blind eye to me .
I quickly took the bag and left the shopping center surreptitiously while I was looking for my friends .
As I could n't find them , I went directly home as if nothing had happened .
When I reached my bedroom , I saw that the exotic boxes I thought carried jewelry actually contained banknotes .
I actually thought it was a dream . When I reacted , I had been as quiet as a mouse for 2 minutes .
The sentence `` What should I do ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I take the money and act as if nothing has occurred , or I try to give the bag back ?
Finally , my regrets convinced me to do a good deed .
Researching for something that would help me give the money back , I found the number of someone we were actually going to meet when I found him on the street .
It was my neighbor !
I gave him the bag and , proud of myself , I went back home thinking about what would have happened if I had selfishly kept the money .
The question of a single Europe and whether this implies a loss of sovereignty for Britain has been a topic of considerable debate for some time .
Last November , one of the principal reasons underlying Mrs. Thatcher 's resignation was her negative stance against increasing involvement in Europe .
Her views were not shared by many of her party colleagues who , on the contrary , were conscious of an all too pressing need for Britain to play an active role in a united Europe .
January 1993 is expected to witness the creation of the Single European Market .
The original sentence `` The aims of such a union are essentially economic . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
All trade barriers will be broken down to encourage and promote free trade between the countries of Europe , in the belief that increased cooperation will lead to increased productivity .
In order to facilitate trade between the different nations , many people are in favor of adopting a common currency , namely the ECU .
This , in turn , would also have to lead to the formation of a central European bank .
A single Europe , while primarily being created as an economic union , will necessarily have implications on a political level .
The European Parliament , of course , already exists , but many people envisage that in a single Europe , it will play a more important role and its power will be extended , possibly surpassing those exercised by individual national governments in Europe and overriding decisions made by them .
For supporters of a single Europe , the question of whether it will entail a loss of British sovereignty is not a primary issue . They would argue , first and foremost , that Britain can not afford to go it alone and that it is in her interests to join forces with the rest of Europe .
Critics of the European Union , on the other hand , are afraid that increased cooperation in both the economic and political spheres will give rise to a European superpower , which will undermine the sovereignty of Britain in these fields .
Personally , I am in favor of a united Europe to the extent that I believe Britain can no longer afford to stand alone in opposition to the other countries in Europe , all of which have long been in favor of such a union .
Moreover , closer cooperation will undoubtedly be favorable and bring about increased productivity and prosperity .
However , I feel hesitant at the prospect of a common currency , at least until such a move might become necessary , as this would certainly mean the loss of British sovereignty from an economic point of view .
Yet , I am even more against the idea of listening to political dictates from Brussels .
If the powers of the European Parliament are extended to the point that it has authority over national governments , our whole democratic political structure will be in grave danger , and Britain will assuredly lose its political sovereignty .
Academic culture differs from one country to another , so it is the most important and challenging task for international students to adjust to the academic culture of Australia for effective learning .
During my studies , I have found a vast difference in academic culture between Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal , memorizing lessons and rote learning are the basis of higher education .
In contrast , in Australia , students are supposed to use online resources for research , reference , study independently , and think critically .
At the beginning , I felt really uncomfortable using online resources , developing my own perspective , and presenting a reasoned argument .
However , studying in Australian academic culture is an incredibly exciting and rewarding experience .
There are definite reasons for the difference in the academic cultures of Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal , university teachers hardly get training , orientation , and research opportunities to update their knowledge , so they stick with the traditional method of teaching .
Teijlingen , E. , & Simkhada , P. ( 2010 ) .
As a result , the students fail to access research literature despite their strong academic success . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
On the other hand , in Australia , courses like EAP are usually designed to improve students ' academic language proficiency and the relevant study skills that will help them throughout their academic life .
It seems like the sentence `` ( Budley ) '' is incomplete or missing context . Could you please provide more information or clarify the sentence you would like corrected ?
Thus , skill-based learning is more useful in our academic life .
In conclusion , for my effective learning at my university , I will access available resources for my research , improve my note-taking skills , interact with teachers and peers in class , attend lectures , and work hard to be an independent learner .
Amongst recent issues , there have been big problems caused by the amount of heavy goods vehicles on British roads today .
This amount of traffic on the roads causes mass congestion on motorways such as the M25 in London and the M61 into Manchester . This static movement on British motorways has caused an increase in gas emissions from car exhausts into the atmosphere , which will eventually contribute to global warming .
A few suggestions have been made to remedy these problems , but with no great effect .
The original sentence `` A number of these are listed below . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
An allowance of better access into Britain 's main industrial centers by the building of large and substantial highways .
A limited number of H.G.V . operators only submitted a few lorries from their fleet to be used on British roads .
A kind of catalytic converter for diesel engines reduces some of the harmful emissions .
Another idea is for the government to introduce some type of tolling system to be used on motorways and main A roads .
A final approach to the problem of congestion on motorways is to make heavy goods transport compulsory by rail only .
Here are only a few suggestions on how to convert British roads , but just these few would be cause for debate .
The problem with these suggestions is that it would cost millions of pounds to put any one of them into practice .
Take the first suggestion , for example : a network of routes into all major industrial cities would cost billions due to the fact that it costs £1 million per mile of motorway .
If there were only a limited number of H.G.V . operators , it would drive a lot of people out of business , and that would n't be in the best interest of the government .
A catalytic converter for diesel engines is a good idea , but it would only reduce gas emissions and not congestion .
All the suggestions I have made have problems , and this is why we still have problems on our roads today .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
My name is Edda Preuß . I am from Germany , and I finished my A-levels this year .
To get some new inspiration and some new ideas about what I would like to do in the future , I planned to take a road trip through the USA .
But my plans suddenly changed when I read your advertisement for the job at the summer camp .
I am a very open-minded person .
I love to travel and explore different cultures .
Furthermore , I do many sports such as swimming , running , and dancing Flamenco , Zumba , and Hip Hop .
I have already worked with children in the past , as I was a swimming teacher for children aged 4 to 7 years , and I also did an internship at a primary school in my town .
I loved organizing all sorts of activities , parties , and meals .
I hope you share my opinion that I am the perfect candidate for the job you offer .
I am looking forward to meeting you personally .
Best regards .
The sentence `` Edda Preuß '' appears to be a name and does not require correction . If you intended to provide more context or if there is a specific issue you would like addressed , please let me know !
Dear Madam or Sir ,
I was pleased to see your report on municipal waste collection released recently , as I have long been interested in the data you have published .
It was also great to see that the percentage of landfilled waste is lower compared to other regions , and I was particularly glad to see that the utilization of waste to recover heat and power has at least been started , even if its proportion is still negligible in the overall treatment of waste .
It is my firm conviction that the proportion of recycled waste needs to grow in the coming years , while the amount of landfilled waste should be reduced to avoid the detrimental effects this latter has on the health conditions of the local population .
Due to this , I would like to propose that you involve locally based companies in decision-making , since they are likely to have a stake in maintaining a clean local environment while being eager to utilize recycled raw materials for their manufacturing processes .
It is imperative that you take my proposal into serious consideration because the growing number of illnesses caused by toxic waste in the soil increases the municipality 's social security expenditures while ruining the lives of local families .
The original sentence `` Yours sincerely , '' is already correct and does not require any changes . It is a standard closing for a formal letter or email .
I 'm sorry , but the sentence `` Carlo Paole '' is incomplete and does n't provide enough context for a correction . Could you provide more information or context for this sentence ?
Genetic manipulation has been going on for many centuries in the form of selective breeding , both of crops and animals.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
This technique has been of great benefit to the human race , enabling the production of more food , better food , and new and interesting varieties of food .
Of course , it is not just food that has benefited from selective breeding ; the development of different natural fibers , such as wool and cotton , has been aided by it .
It is only in very recent times that genetic manipulation has been seen to have bad sides as well as good ones .
This is because we are now at the stage where scientists can alter an organism by changing its genes in some way . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I do not believe that the scientists who originally began research into the nature of genetics had any idea that it would one day be put to bad ( or good ) use—they simply wanted to find out what it was all about and , hence , can not be blamed for any later events .
Today , much research is being carried out on human genes to find out how they work and whether they can be altered to prevent diseases .
The scientists who work on this can not be blamed if someone else uses their technique for less philanthropic ends—for example , in biological warfare , or to eliminate a 'gay ' or 'criminal ' gene which may be present in human embryos .
Where scientists can be blamed , however , is in the case of genetically engineered tomatoes .
These are now available in a supermarket near you , with their genes altered to increase their redness , juiciness , or resistance to disease .
These tomatoes are probably perfectly safe , but if they , or some other genetically engineered food , prove to cause a terrible disease , then that is the fault of the scientist who developed them , because they did not test them adequately to make sure they were safe .
Similarly , if genetically engineered vaccines or medicines prove to have harmful side effects , it is because they were not adequately tested before being released into the market , and the scientists are to blame .
The original sentence `` To whom it may concern , '' is already correct and does not require any changes . It is a standard salutation used in formal letters when the recipient is unknown .
I am writing this letter because I believe I am a suitable candidate for this job .
I love working with kids , and I have a lot of experience taking care of them , as well as organizing different activities .
I love working in the kitchen , and I am an excellent cook .
The sentence `` Sincerely , '' is typically used as a closing in a letter or email , and it does n't require correction . However , if you are looking for a more formal or complete closing , you might consider adding your name or a title after `` Sincerely , '' like this : Sincerely , [ Your Name ]
It seems like the sentence `` Natalia '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or additional information so I can help you correct or complete it ?
Everyone knows that famous people have a hard life .
There are constantly in mind , in the center of attention .
Famous people actually do not have personal time .
Is it correct ?
In my opinion , `` no . '' I think these people deserve freedom .
Celebrities have 2 lives .
First , life is for the society and press .
Second Life is private , without cameras and journalists .
Like any normal person , these people want silence and rest after a hard day .
Sometimes journalists wait for their `` victims '' around houses and restaurants .
The sentence `` It is not very nice . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
Often , they are asked inappropriate and unpleasant questions .
Famous people also want to spend time with family and friends .
I think to solve this problem , we need to indicate the time and place where the famous person will give the interview .
Police can arrest journalists if they take interviews in the wrong place .
Then , I think this would facilitate the lives of famous people .
For one thing , they are people , not machines .
The National Lottery was introduced to Britain in November 1994.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Since the first draw , it has become increasingly popular , involving millions of people across the country each week .
The proposal of a lottery brought about many objections and complaints .
There were , and still are , two principal concerns the Anti-National Lottery Campaigners still have .
For people living in high society , a 'flutter ' on the National Lottery each week has no effect on their financial position .
These kinds of people can afford to spend £10–20 a week .
The concern lies with the , and I use the term lightly , 'working class citizens ' .
These people work hard throughout the year and can not afford to spend large amounts of money on the lottery .
The problem is that these working men and women , as well as unemployed men and women , spend money they ca n't afford .
The second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The National Lottery , after all , is another gambling game .
The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million , and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58 .
It is gambling , but more importantly , it is gambling made available to 16-year-olds .
A lot of the gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery .
These are easily purchased , and the attraction is winning on the spot .
The thought of being rich instantly encourages gamblers , young and old and underage , to purchase tickets .
The National Lottery , however , has its good points .
There is one main advantage to the lottery .
It has helped charities and societies around the country achieve things that would otherwise have been impossible .
From buying a young child with brain problems a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland Islands , the lottery has helped young and old , far and wide .
The lottery has also created jobs , encouraged spending , and made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like to be rich .
The National Lottery has its good points and its bad points .
Deciding whether it should have been introduced or not is very much a personal thing and depends on how important you rate the points I have emphasized in this essay .
I believe it is a benefit to the country .
Dear Student Film Club ,
I thought I might help you choose an awesome movie for the club .
A thriller , actually .
I absolutely loved this one because of its amazing actors , Leonardo DiCaprio and Blake Lively .
They played a married couple in their early thirties who had just moved to a lake house .
Of course , after a few weeks , strange things started happening .
At night , they heard weird noises and moans coming from the lake .
Furthermore , the woman started to see shadows and movements around the water .
The original sentence `` And it only got worse . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
I do n't want to give you a huge spoiler and ruin everything , so I am only going to tell you that it will get pretty exciting .
Someone is going to die , and there is going to be a lot of blood .
The original sentence `` I really recommend watching this thriller . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
If you have the guts , you will love it just as much as I did .
The original sentence `` Until next time , Lea . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Hi Jo ,
I am so glad to hear from you .
The original sentence is already correct . However , if you want to make a slight adjustment for clarity or emphasis , you could say : '' I am very happy that you have decided to come to my city .
This is a great idea because it means we can spend some time together .
First of all , I would like to know how you are going to travel .
From your city to mine , you can travel by plane , train , or bus ; whichever you choose , you have connections to the center of the city . However , for me , the fastest way is traveling by plane .
From the airport , there are different modes of transport , such as buses , trains , or the underground , that can take you to the city in less than half an hour .
Traveling within the city is quite expensive ; however , if you get a one-day travel card , you will save money .
Although getting a job is quite a bit harder than last year , many agencies are looking for employees just for the summer time .
You can try to get a job as a waitress in fast food restaurants or as a retail assistant in shopping centers .
I hope this helps you .
See you .
The author uses a third person narrator , which employs third person pronouns such as `` his '' or `` their '' .
The story is seen through the eyes of Susan . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The narrator knows her feelings and thoughts and is able to see what she sees , but he does not know any of the thoughts or feelings of the other characters .
One point that illustrates this is the scene in which Susan talks to Annie , wondering what Annie might think about her plan to save the dog .
From all these points , one can conclude that the narrator has a limited point of view .
Another point to analyze is the mode of presentation .
In the short story , we can mostly find scenic presentation .
The events are described in detail , for example , when every step of Susan 's is described .
There is only one exception , where the mode of presentation is a panoramic one , when the events of the holidays are summed up in the second paragraph .
Furthermore , the story is made up of parts of external action and parts of internal action , such as the interior monologue , where the reader gets to know all of Susan 's thoughts in detail .
Save Billy is a short story written in an informal register , which can be recognized by the use of informal words such as `` kiddies '' and short forms like `` did n't '' and `` is n't .
The aim of this study is to verify the research trends in the Revista Educação Especial during the years 2010 - 2013 and to identify the most developed research themes in recent years ; it also identifies undeveloped or absent themes in the last four years .
The selection of the journal is justified because it is a journal with a wide , consolidated readership and publishes only articles on Special Education .
This is a bibliographic research of qualitative and quantitative nature .
The articles analyzed were accessed from the journal site , resulting in 134 articles .
The collected information was organized into frameworks outlining developed themes and indicating the number of articles discussing each subject . It also tabulated the institution and noted whether the article presented participants or not , and who the participants were .
The results showed that the institutions publishing more in the journal are the Universidade Federal de São Carlos and Universidade Federal de Santa Maria . The majority of the research does n't present participants , followed by studies with interventions made with professionals .
The topics most published are Special Education and School Inclusion , while the least published are prevention and defining disability .
Noticed that some disabilities are poorly studied or do n't have effective interventions . For example , in the case of global developmental disorders , there is a great focus on working with autism , but little or almost nothing is presented on the other conditions that fall into this group .
Another example is in relation to the articles dealing with the issue of deafness , on which we can verify only one out of twelve associated with cochlear implantation .
The doorbell rang . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
When I opened the door , imagine my surprise when I saw Maria Shaw , my favourite singer , in front of me .
She looked as beautiful as I had seen her in clips , but a bit worried .
I need help ; I am completely lost , and I need to get to Valencia .
Furthermore , my car is broken , '' she said , and I replied , `` There 's no problem .
I 'm going to take you to your concert .
It was very exciting because nobody had visited me at my cottage , but that day my luck changed .
In my journey with Maria , I asked her a lot of questions .
She was very friendly and told me a lot of jokes .
She invited me to the concert , and it was wonderful . I had tried to buy tickets , but it was impossible because they had been sold out in less than an hour .
The best moment of the night was when she dedicated a song to me , and later she invited me to supper with all her staff .
What a marvelous woman I met that day .
I think many people use car travel because it 's easy , but when you are on the road with your own car , there are a lot of disadvantages .
One of these is traffic : if you take the tube , you will probably not stay in a tailback for minutes , and you will move faster underground .
For me , people almost did n't find the real potential of public transport .
Many of them think that moving with their own car is better .
The high number of cars is really damaging to the environment , and the pollution increases every day .
I hope that there will be a future for public transport that is more effective than the car .
I think there are advantages and disadvantages to cars .
An advantage is that you can go everywhere you want with your car , but a big disadvantage is the traffic .
Another disadvantage is finding a parking spot for the car in the city center .
Public transport also has advantages and disadvantages .
For example , public transport has designated stops to make , and sometimes there is a slight delay .
But a big advantage , especially for the underground , is the absolute absence of traffic .
Old computers were much bigger and more complicated to handle than recent ones .
The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes : '' They could n't access the Internet since there simply was no such thing .
You had to command the device by typing instructions in specific ways that few people knew . The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
There were n't any mice , and it was impossible to connect anything wirelessly .
One could only play a small number of games on old computers .
All of these features did not make computers very popular among common people , but they were used almost exclusively by scientists and mathematicians .
The original sentence `` Nobody would use them nowadays ! '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
They were far less practical and comfortable than our current everyday devices .
In fact , there is no future for public transport . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
As far as public transport is concerned , there does not seem to be a way forward unless they can reduce the enormous amounts of petrol needed to fuel it .
In my view , the type of transport that we are accustomed to will gradually diminish .
On the other hand , the vehicle industry has managed to create efficient electric cars , so much so that they do not need petrol .
This is a huge advance for the environment and also a huge problem for the development of public transport .
It can be seen that each year there are more and more new electric models from Toyota and other brands .
Far from being only a benefit for the environment , this fact is also positive for travelers , who will experience a significant reduction in travel costs with this new type of car , which is causing a direct decrease in the use of public transport .
At this point , something seems to be clear for the public transport industries : their future depends on how they will be able to get more efficient trains , buses , or planes .
The original sentence `` Why ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
There are two reasons : prices and environmental protection .
Yesterday , I was with my grandpa and my dog , Willi , on the beach .
Willi is a two-year-old beautiful poodle , which I got as a Christmas present .
Well , Willi likes hunting , so my grandpa threw his stick into the water .
Immediately , Willi turned and ran for the stick .
He was back in a minute .
Then , a strange man came to us .
He was tall and slim , and he was wearing a coat .
He kept a stick in his hand , but his was bigger than my grandpa 's .
As he saw Willi , he threw his stick into the water too and wanted Willi to bring it back .
But he did n't want to catch the man 's stick , so he turned around and walked away .
Of course , we left with him .
The man was shouting at us to return for a minute , but then he stopped .
The stick was still lying on the water , so he had no choice but to jump into the water for it .
Although the man was angry , it was very funny for us .
The original sentence `` Do you agree or disagree ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The more money people have , the more they should give away to charity .
Nowadays , more and more people discuss whether it is a responsibility for a person who possesses more money to contribute to society .
Donate more money to charity .
Some people think that the more money a rich man has , the more useless it is , so he should give it away .
He gave away a portion of his fortune for charity .
By doing this , he can use them to maximum effect . I can not agree .
With this idea .
There are numerous reasons to support me . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Money can be used not only for donating to charity but also for maintaining a perfect daily life .
If we want to live ,
Longer , we have to maintain a happy mind every day.Corrected sentence : We have to maintain a happy mind every day .
For maintaining a happy mindset , someone shops every day .
It seems like the sentence `` When they '' is incomplete . To provide a corrected version , we would need more context or the rest of the sentence . Could you provide additional information or the full sentence ?
They see what they want to buy and purchase it without the slightest hesitation .
Therefore , they can have a happy life .
Life every day .
In addition to buying what you want , money can also be used to create a more wonderful world .
It seems like the sentence `` There are many '' is incomplete . Could you please provide more context or the rest of the sentence so I can help you with the correction ?
Diseases that can not be cured .
Therefore , rich men can use their fortune to build a group that is made up of the
An excellent biological scientist is needed to research some new useful medicine to rescue more dying people .
Furthermore , giving away money to charity is not a privilege reserved only for rich people ; common people can also contribute .
Donate money to a philanthropic organization .
Some people think living a plain life is the best thing for them .
Therefore , common people contribute a portion of their fortune to charity and just live a simple life .
It is .
So kind that they have great lives every day .
Dear Mrs. Ashby ,
I am writing to apply for the position of COOK , as seen in your advertisement .
I am a 25-year-old girl , and I am a student .
I love cooking . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I am interested in many exotic cultures , for example , Chinese and Japanese food .
What draws us to Facebook ?
More than 500 million users log on to the site every day , but many of them bemoan Facebook as a time-suck , although they could spend this time more productively on work , schoolwork , or real face time with family and friends .
But something keeps drawing us in : the allure of Facebook can boost our self-esteem , satisfy our need for connectedness and self-promotion , and help us maintain offline relationships .
But we do n't use Facebook in the same way ; there are the sociable , the lonely , and the narcissistic who go on Facebook to satisfy different needs .
The University psychologist Stefan Hofmann found out that we use Facebook to satisfy two needs .
On the one hand , we need to belong , and on the other , we need self-presentation .
Facebook satisfies both of those basic needs , says Hofmann . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Some people think that Facebook is a blessing for interpersonal connection .
But other people think Facebook makes us lonely and removes the contact with real friends .
Social Psychology , Sheldon found out that spending a lot of time on Facebook is associated with both high levels of feeling connected to other people and high levels of disconnection .
A new study suggests that we gain some psychological benefits even from passively viewing our own profiles .
In a 2011 study of about 300 college students , researchers Amy Gonzales and Jeffrey Hancock found that students who were asked to look at their own Facebook page for just three minutes showed a boost in self-esteem compared with control groups who either looked in a mirror or simply sat in a room for three minutes .
The researchers suspect this is because we can self-select what other people can see on our profile .
Facebook can allow people to access information that they would n't otherwise know , such as a new job opportunity or a news story they might have missed .
The more different kinds of people you have in your network , the better chance you have of getting useful information .
Researchers believe social networking is likely to continue growing .
The doorbell rang . ( Note : The original sentence `` The doorbell rang . '' is already correct and does not require any changes . )
When I opened the door , you can imagine my surprise .
I was shocked . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
He looked like Luke Guina . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The original sentence `` I wondered how that could really be . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I looked at him , and he looked at me .
I was sure—totally sure .
He sang in my favorite band .
I cried , `` Oh my fucking god , you are Luke Guina , right ? I am probably your biggest fan .
How can it be that I met you at our school ?
I have been to so many concerts and never had the chance to speak to you .
He laughed and answered , `` Wow , I did n't think anybody knew me in this school .
Well , my band is not so famous right now , but thank you for these compliments .
I am really happy for them .
I will go to school here starting from now . We had a nice conversation , and I finally found a very good friend in Luke .
I love the music of his band , and maybe I will be part of the group as a second singer .
The original sentence `` I would like to write about my family . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I am a mother of two grown-up children .
I am a part-time employee , working in a laboratory as a specimen receptionist .
The original sentence `` I have been working there for almost nine years . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I came to the United Kingdom in 2004 with my husband and my children .
My husband came here as a student to study for his PhD . In the beginning , I was the only one who earned money in the family .
Because of that , it was hard to provide daily necessities for our young children .
At that time , my daughter was a teenager .
Initially , she had to struggle to adjust herself to a completely new environment .
But I am happy to say that after ten years of hardship , my husband managed to find a proper job , and my daughter has also become a sensible , smart woman . At the moment , she is studying for a degree in Developmental Physiology .
Dear Grace ,
You had a bad accident that changed your life forever . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
It 's normal that now you 're depressed and you think it 's not worth living anymore , but you must think about all the beautiful things that you can do anyway , even if you 'll do them in a different way .
You need to think positively and try to enjoy yourself . Do n't think about the past ; just live your life in the present . Do n't be discouraged , and do n't let this problem change your life .
Even if it seems impossible to be optimistic , it depends only on you ; you need to want it .
In order to determine whether or not crime pays , one should first define what is meant by the word `` pays .
If a person gains $ 100 in a jewelry store theft , yet uses ten dollars ' worth of gas to get away , cuts his hand on a broken window and pays $ 50 in medical bills , and spends another $ 50 for a hideout hotel room , then his crime has actually left him ten dollars in the hole .
However , the question of crime paying requires a deeper level of `` pay '' than simple dollars-and-cents accounting .
In terms of criminal work , pay must be weighed as gains made from crime versus all manner of loss that occurs as a result .
One issue to consider as a loss is the type of capital loss illustrated above .
Crime , like any small business , requires an investment .
The original sentence `` One investment is time . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
If the time involved in planning and committing a crime does not result in a gain that justifies that time expenditure , then the crime has not paid off .
Whether or not crime pays in this instance depends on how much money a criminal could make in a legitimate field . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
If the criminal can only expect to earn minimum wage in a legal job , then crimes may not earn enough to justify the time spent .
If a criminal is well-educated and could function in one of the professions , then his crimes must earn him more .
Other capital investments in crime could include equipment such as getaway cars , dynamite , weaponry , and disguises .
Mafia and police pay-offs could be involved .
Dealing in stolen property or other contraband could require splitting the money earned with other involved parties .
A crime 's income must be enough to cover all these expenses .
Another type of loss to be considered is the loss of mental or physical health and well-being .
Many times , violence is a part of crime .
The cost of taking a gunshot or knife wound in the leg is more than just the medical bills .
The original sentence `` It could be an injury that keeps someone from ever working again . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Very few criminals have workers ' compensation .
The stress that comes from the constant risk of injury and incarceration is a cost in itself and could lessen both a person 's lifespan and enjoyment of life .
Legal problems could result in both a capital loss and a health-related loss .
Lawyers can be very expensive , and if a criminal chooses to avoid the financial cost of a more expensive attorney , he might pay with the consequence of being imprisoned .
Even if someone is not imprisoned , long legal entanglements can be very stressful and unhealthy.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence `` Does crime pay ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
In some cases , it may , but the small businessman criminal must deal with the same risks as the legitimate businessman .
Larger criminal corporations will always seek to drive him out of business , and he may have to work long hours for small gains . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
However , he does better than the legitimate businessman on one count : no taxes .
In my hometown of Kalamazoo , the invention of the shopping mall has changed the lives of the people in our town and the town itself .
While many people enjoy and utilize shopping malls , I believe that they are more of a detriment than a blessing .
Kalamazoo , like most American cities , began to develop around the central means of transportation .
Cities were first located near water , then near train tracks , and then began to be located farther away due to the invention of trucks and cars .
Downtown Kalamazoo was once a thriving and successful district . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Near the train station were the larger industries and other essential specialized stores for everyday supplies .
Homes and neighborhoods were located outside of the central city ; however , many stores had several floors of apartments above them to accommodate families .
Everyone was near the central city , so everyone could use its facilities .
Rich and poor alike had easy access to the offerings of the central city .
Throughout history , the trend has been for the rich to get richer and the poor to remain poor .
While the rich got richer , they began building specialized shops and strip malls outside the city limits .
And the more wealthy moved from the inner city ( with help from the invention of the automobile ) to the suburbs , where they could keep a distance from the busy inner city .
While the wealthier individuals began moving away from the inner city , the poor and lower working class remained due to a lack of transportation or money to move outward .
This process has left the businesses in the inner cities , including Kalamazoo , without a stable clientele .
Why should we , say those with cars , go downtown where the poorer people are and have to shop outside , going from specialized store to store , when we can go to a nice indoor mall that has everything ?
Businesses that could move out of the downtown district did , and still do , relocating in strip malls near the main malls or in the malls themselves .
I believe it is only the storeowners who realize this process is occurring or who enjoy the downtown district that remain and stay in business .
Many larger factories and office buildings still remain downtown .
And the executives and business people rely on commuting to and from the city daily without taking advantage of what was once a thriving neighborhood .
And it still could be !
One feature that does attract businesses is colleges .
Kalamazoo has one large university , one private college , and two community colleges .
It seems like the sentence `` colleges '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or the rest of the sentence so I can help you correct it ?
The large and private universities are within walking distance of downtown Kalamazoo , so many businesses try to cater to our tastes—clubs , cafés , and other stores .
Another attempt to reinstate success is hosting downtown festivals .
We have many , and they always attract people from the suburbs .
This disintegration of the inner city is detrimental to the people it affects : the poor and the lower middle class .
Their neighborhoods do n't get financial support , and money is not spent in the stores near them .
If they could have more money and leave , the majority would .
Shopping malls , strip malls , and the flight from the inner cities by upper-class Americans will only hurt those who ca n't escape in the end—in fact , it is already hurting businesses and lives in the downtown districts .
Hello .
Firstly , I would like to introduce myself : I 'm 32 years old , and I come from Poland .
The first time I checked this website , I thought it was too difficult .
For me , today I will try to write something using this .
It seems like the sentence `` website . '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or the full sentence so I can help you correct it ?
I chose this subject , but I do n't have any idea what I should write .
So , could you provide more context or a complete sentence for me to help with the correction ?
Maybe I will try to write you something about myself .
What I do in my life and why I 'm here is something I often contemplate .
Firstly and most importantly , what I want to say is that I have
I started learning English 2 years ago .
Privately , I 'm working as a firefighter ; it 's attractive but also very demanding .
The sentence `` dangerous profession '' is incomplete . A corrected version would need additional context to form a complete sentence . Here is one possibility : Corrected sentence : Boxing is considered a dangerous profession .
For me , English is really important , and I feel much better when
I go somewhere , and I can talk with people from a different background .
It seems like the sentence `` country . '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or additional words to form a complete sentence ? That way , I can help you correct or improve it .
I often travel , which is why from time to time I can use English .
It seems like the sentence you provided is incomplete . Could you please provide the full sentence so I can help you with the correction ?
The second advantage of why I try to learn this language is that I need it .
I 'm sorry , but the sentence `` in my work '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or the rest of the sentence so I can help you correct it ?
I remembered a situation from 2 years ago involving some firefighters .
England visited my company , and they stayed in Poland for two weeks .
We went with them to some kind of socializing event where we socialized and met new people .
Could you please provide more context or the full sentence that needs correction ? This will help me assist you better .
I felt really bad when I could n't cooperate with the team .
England . ( This sentence is already correct , but if you intended to provide more context or a complete thought , you might consider expanding it . For example : `` England is known for its rich history and cultural heritage . '' )
That is why I 'm here ; my friend from Poland sent me your address .
So , thanks for your help .
Best wishes , Patrick
The advancement in technology has a major influence over transportation systems , and the new roadways are more convenient to travel .
As personal transportation provides more convenient options to people , the public transport system is losing its market .
The market for personal vehicles has become cheaper and safer than before , leading to a major increase in their growth .
Now , people being more professional are quite keen to save their valuable time by moving from scheduled public transport to personal cars . Luxury and speed have become status symbols for car owners , and it is also a better way to avoid public interaction and annoyance .
New multitasking lifestyle better suits the preference for personal cars , to keep and carry all those things one needs .
Since Maggie 's class won the prize in the basketball game , their teacher took them to a nature reserve to observe animals.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Maggie , with her best friends , was so excited that they kept taking pictures with animals .
Halfway through the tour , they went to the hippo area .
Fortunately , the hippo mother gave birth last month .
The hippo baby was so cute that Maggie wanted to take a closer picture with it .
However , little did Maggie know that the mother was nearby and assumed that she was attacking her baby .
The mother ran out of the river and chased after Maggie . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
As the teacher saw the scene , she called the staff of the reserve to save Maggie from the terrifying hippo .
After a few minutes , several strong men came to shoot it with a tranquilizer dart .
It was such a fortunate event that no one was injured .
Nevertheless , Maggie sincerely regretted being a troublemaker .
She has vowed that she will stay away from wild animals , no matter how gentle they might look .
During the 20th century , there have been several worldwide discoveries that have significantly influenced people 's lives .
I think that the most significant discovery or invention will depend on the individual . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Every individual holds a different perspective on life and what they consider to be valuable and important .
I chose cultural awareness and understanding prejudice and discrimination as my topic because I greatly value all of humanity , and I believe that all people should learn to live in peace .
Cultural and racial equality is a new term that , as a society , we are striving for .
People have come to realize that racism is almost inherent in today 's society.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
As individuals , we are constantly surrounded by racist and discriminatory media language and advertising .
In the past , this type of discrimination , which includes not only African Americans but also other ethnicities and women , has been accepted as a way of life .
Few individuals have been courageous enough to challenge the deeply bred stereotypes and inequality , and demand freedom and equality .
Numerous hidden talents , strong , wise personal voices , and the great knowledge and learning that result from human experience and suffering have been buried under the ignorance of our society .
However , today we are beginning to move in a new direction . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
People are understanding that prejudice and discrimination are not consciously learned , but they must be unlearned .
Together as a society , and as a much larger world , we are recognizing the value in learning from difference .
Cultural differences are no longer being ignored or concealed , but rather they are being celebrated .
Organizations and forums are presently being held to discover new ways of dealing with discrimination and racism .
The opportunity to learn about the vast world around us is opening up , and the availability to study cultural differences and reflect on that knowledge ourselves is improving .
Unlearning prejudice may not seem like a traditional discovery , but it is very significant to the development and peaceful existence of all humanity .
As human beings , we need each other , and we need to be willing to accept those who are different .
The advantage of being famous is mainly that you have more privileges than other people , like entering places without waiting in line or even not paying your bill in some cases .
On the other hand , in my opinion , it has more bad things than good ones .
Everyone can recognize you , and then they might bother you to ask for a signature .
So you ca n't move freely anywhere , and you have to hide to rest from the crowds .
That 's all , in my view .
Hello , I 'm Alisa , an Italian girl who is 27 years old . I would like to apply for this job opportunity , as my dream is to go to the USA .
Moreover , this way seems to be perfect for realizing it .
I believe I am a suitable person to join your staff , as I already have experience working with children . I enjoy working with them because they are so genuine and imaginative . Essentially , you do n't work for them but `` with '' them .
I adore children , and usually , they love me .
I 'm a cheerful , willing , educated person .
I speak Italian as my mother tongue , and I have a good level of English and French .
I have been playing volleyball for 12 years , and I used to attend a theatre course . I have a degree in fine arts as well , so I should be able to easily organize sports and creative activities .
Furthermore , I have a pastry degree , and I 'm not afraid to work in the kitchen ; cooking and baking are some of my favorite hobbies .
I hope my candidacy will be considered .
The sentence `` Best regards , '' is already correct and does not require any changes . It is a standard closing for a letter or email .
It seems like the sentence `` Alisa '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or additional information so I can help you correct or complete it ?
For as long as man has been alive , he has invented things .
The original sentence `` Important early discoveries included the wheel and fire . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
In the long line of such discoveries , modern man has continuously found new ways to make his life easier .
So , naturally , when man invented the washing machine , millions and millions of lives were made simpler .
The washing machine , in those houses that own them , has almost become a necessity .
Should there be a fire in the house , many people might be seen furiously running about in the streets , clutching the machines tightly to their chests .
In today 's society , to be without a washing machine or any other electric gadget seems to be devastating .
Corrected sentence : Whatever would a college student do without a washing machine ?
The original sentence `` Where would we find the time to hand wash our clothes ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes : '' The mere thought of washing clothes by hand causes panic in most teenagers , students , and adults alike .
This modern invention , the washing machine , has instilled a fear of hand-washing clothes in the hearts of many .
Give an average adult a washboard and soap , and tell him or her to do a load of laundry , and watch the panicked look on his or her face .
Thus , it is easy to see that while washing machines , microwaves , toaster ovens , and millions of other gadgets facilitate our modern lives , they also contribute to our modern process of rushing around .
These `` wonders '' make it easier to spend less time doing manual labor . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Corrected sentence : But is that all that bad ? ( The original sentence is already correct . )
Many housewives would insist on its benefits , and I would have to agree .
But the washing machine is just another invention in a long line of inventions that make our lives easier , yet do n't allow us to exercise or use our muscles .
It is no small wonder that in today 's `` modern '' society , as we continuously use our `` modern gadgets , '' we increasingly need diet programs and other such systems .
Yes , the old days were hard , but were Weight Watchers ever an issue ?
The original sentence is already correct . No changes are needed : '' Nowadays , more and more parents are starting to teach their children at home instead of sending them to school .
This may not be a bad idea at all , but it also has some disadvantages that I would like to discuss . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Firstly , we should take into account the fact that parents are n't usually specialized in all fields of study ; even if they have a degree in history , they may not know how to help their children with a mathematics problem .
Besides , staying at home rather than going to school reduces the opportunities to meet new people and make friends .
This is n't a good thing for the children because , that way , they are n't socializing , and when the moment comes to have an interview to get a job , they wo n't really know how to behave .
On the other hand , having the chance to learn at home helps some students who , due to their complicated situations—such as an illness— can not go to school like the other children .
To sum up , I consider that children should study at school if they can afford it because , in the majority of cases , parents do n't have the same knowledge as teachers .
Boxing is one of the most popular sports of this era , but it is also one of the most deadly .
During a fight , a boxer may receive several hundred punches to the head , and each time he gets punched , he loses more and more brain cells .
The brain is encased in the skull , but not only is the brain in the skull , but there is also a liquid 'shock absorber ' to protect the brain .
Even though there is protective liquid , the brain still gets bounced around against the skull , damaging it more and more every time .
So , a boxer who has been boxing for a number of years—ten , for example—and retires is very likely to have brain damage . It could be very severe or hardly noticeable , but the damage is still there .
Getting away from the long-term effects to the short-term effects , yes , brain cells are still being killed , but when a boxer receives a very strong punch directly to the face , not only could it damage his nose , eyes , teeth , and general facial features , but it could also cause him to enter a coma , hemorrhage , or die .
Another aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top-ranked boxers receive .
The question that people have is : Is that person really worth several million pounds ?
Just for a fight against another top-ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds , it seems hardly worth the risk .
Another consideration of cost is the expense of having so many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be elsewhere , in more important places , where people are n't getting paid to fight .
The major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport ; there is an incredibly big demand for it .
Boxing is one of the most popular sports , so it will be difficult to ban it .
Not only does it satisfy the viewers , but a lot of companies also sponsor boxing , which brings a lot of advertisement and capital for them .
A study group is a gathering of people who come together to discuss topics they have chosen .
So , if you join a study group , you can understand what others ' ideas are and how they think about this problem .
Also , you can exchange your own ideas with others so that there will be a discussion about them .
Through this discussion , I think we can realize our thinking and others ' opinions more clearly .
Another benefit is that you can seize the opportunity to express yourself efficiently and methodically ; that is , your speaking skills will be improved .
However , why do some people still study on their own ? ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
In my opinion , I need to consider one question deeply by myself .
Sometimes , too many other thoughts disturb me !
Maybe I will become a person who only listens to others ' ideas and never thinks for myself if I rely too heavily on study groups .
To join study groups is a good way to inspire your learning motivation , but do n't forget that sometimes you have to be alone and reflect on what you have learned calmly .
My favourite sport is football . The first time I saw it was nine years ago , and I liked it so much .
It was a game between Chelsea and Bolton , and Chelsea won 5-1 .
I got a lot of new feelings because I have never liked it and never watched it before .
I noticed that Lampard was a leader of that team , and he scored two times in that game .
Now , I have been supporting Chelsea for nine years , and I can assume that it was love at first sight .
My advice for people who play is to never give up playing and supporting the club that gave you the chance to play and be a part of the team .
Respect your coach even if he is very strict .
You have to put a lot of effort into this stuff if you want to reach your goals and aims .
You have to be ready to get through a lot of trauma , injuries , and problems which you will meet on your road to success .
If you put in a lot of effort now and are strong enough to get through , you will be proud and achieve everything you wanted to achieve .
Dear Thomas ,
Recently , you asked me about a place you were about to visit .
The original sentence `` I think there is a perfect spot for you ! '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
In the heart of Katowice , there is an apartment with a specific aura of mystery .
This attic flat was used as a painting studio by the famous Silesian painter and performer Andrzej Urbanowicz , who died a year ago .
The place hides a fascinating story of underground culture in Silesia . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
For quite a long time ( especially in the 60s ) , the studio was frequented by lots of bohemian artists , where they could follow occult and Buddhist practices as well as paint some psychedelic pieces of art .
The apartment at some point was close to the famous Andy Warhol 's studio , which was rented back in the '60s in New York City .
Urbanowicz had created a fantastic place full of rather peculiar yet fascinating things and a Far East atmosphere—there are loads of figurines , paintings , old lamps , carpets , and… dolls reminiscent of those from horror films such as `` Child 's Play .
Some time ago , I took the opportunity and experienced this magical aura for myself .
Just for once , the apartment had been changed into a temporary cinema for those who came to see the film by Nina Menkes , `` The Phantom Love , '' which fit in with the surroundings just perfectly .
I must say I ca n't imagine a better place to feel and see the Silesian history of art , so I recommend it to you from the bottom of my heart .
Yours sincerely ,
The sentence `` Patrycja . '' is incomplete and lacks context . To correct it , you would need to provide additional information or context . For example , if you intended to introduce someone named Patrycja , you might say : Corrected sentence : `` Patrycja is my friend from Poland . `` If you have a specific context or intention for the sentence , please provide more details so I can assist you further .
Experience shows that the only thing that matters is if you love what you do ; because of this , I have helped you to prepare for your concert .
I can say that experience is demonstrated through practice and theory . You have to like what you do ; I helped with a lot of love because I admire the job .
I gathered a lot of experience from my expeditions through many countries , and we were DJs at clubs . I felt so good when I saw that many people gathered at my concerts .
I try my best to make people feel good and have fun with my music . What I can say is that I truly love what I do , which is why I helped you with ease .
I hope you will go and try , and send me an email back with your successful experiences .
In my area , I collected all this experience , and I feel like a happy man .
Now that I got away , I 'm a talented artist .
With respect , I welcome you , my friend , and again I say it was a pleasure to help you !
It is said that boxing should be banned . Described as a barbaric sport , it has been known to lead to deaths and brain damage of fighters .
The constant pounding of the head during a match does n't necessarily take its toll immediately , but as a boxer 's career continues , the chances of him having some kind of serious brain damage are fairly high .
Is it right that we watch with excitement as someone is repeatedly battered about the head until they are no longer able to stand ? Could this not have an effect on our general attitude towards violence ? Children are brought up to 'worship ' idols such as Frank Bruno as he pummels someone into a hazy blur .
Should boxing be banned ?
My answer to all of these questions is no .
Maybe boxing is brutal , but fighting is part of human nature , and I feel there is no point in trying to stop people from fighting in controlled circumstances .
Who has the right to tell someone whether they are able to take a chance and face the risk of death ?
If boxing were banned , where would we draw the line ? Skiing ?
Mountaineering ?
Could you please provide more context or clarify what you would like corrected in the sentence `` diving ? `` ?
Darts ? I feel it is a human right to be allowed to face the risk of death , and a matter of personal opinion whether you watch it or not . Boxing is usually on late at night , and children only watch it if their parents allow them to .
I think boxing should be encouraged . In run-down inner-city areas such as Moss Side , boxing is popular . It gives young lads a focus in life and provides them with a target .
Many of the best boxers came from such areas ; in my opinion , they are better off boxing than stealing cars , taking drugs , and shooting each other .
Banning boxing is simply unnecessary ; if it were banned , then it would simply continue 'underground ' .
This would mean that boxing would become a much more dangerous sport , as expert medical attention and proper match control would n't be ensured . The use of pads may also be ignored .
The only suitable action to be taken would be to increase safety regulations , i.e. ,
Head guards and better gloves should be used in all fights , or the length of fights should be shortened to reduce some of the constant pounding .
Gaining entertainment ! ( This phrase is incomplete and lacks context . A possible correction could be : `` We are gaining entertainment from this activity ! '' )
Sports have been , throughout history , one of the many entertaining things to watch .
The international survey announced by Sports Watch caught my attention , and I would like to present my life on a plate .
Firstly , most of us enjoy watching football . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Is there always someone who would not stop to comment on the unbelievably new situation happening in the match ?
Even though I am a girl , football is one of the main sports I watch on TV .
My eyes sparkle when I wait for a score to end the match or when a red card is given unfairly .
The second one would be skiing . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I enjoy this sport and feel a sense of admiration for those who practice it .
For them to be prepared for many obstacles and to chase around the clock to the finish line is amazing .
You need to focus , have a lot of energy , and mostly strength .
Not everyone is able to cope with that , which is something that should be recognized .
Are you thinking of an influence on the way sports developed ?
In my opinion , tradition remains even in the 21st century , and sports differ from country to country .
On the whole , it does seem that watching sports entertains people from all over the world .
When the bank notes are made , the background color , artwork , and security features should be designed carefully .
Then , skilled machinists manipulate the preparation of the metal plates .
What 's more , printing is a very important step for thinking about sheets , color , special ink , and so on .
While the most important step is inspection .
In this step , it produces good quality sheets , bad sheets , and partially damaged sheets .
The good parts of partially damaged sheets will be cut into separate banknotes , packed , and dispatched for packaging and distribution with good-quality sheets .
While the bad sheets and bad parts will be destroyed for disposal , the rest will be salvaged .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time . '' The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
I definitely agree with this statement .
We are all human .
The original sentence `` That means everyone deserves privacy . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
It does not matter who we are , even in public life .
Film stars sometimes should be awarded for their patience in confrontations with journalists .
The spicy news about politicians and other celebrities , like film stars , is most wanted in our lives today .
The truth is that politicians should take responsibility for their decisions in government and take into consideration the words they say .
It also covers film stars , because they 're considered the last word to the younger generation .
In my opinion , there should be some hard borders that paparazzi can not cross .
They should n't hound celebrities during their holidays or when they have some family problems or just problems themselves .
Today 's people are fed with gossip .
We live in the 21st century , so people who decide to be public figures should be willing to appear before photographers and pushy paparazzi who want to poke their noses into their privacy by all means .
One of the most incredible 20th-century discoveries , in my opinion , is the cellular telephone .
Many people buy them to take with them wherever they go , so they can receive a call at any time .
They are a complete luxury , not a necessity .
The cellular telephone has changed people 's lives in many ways , the main way being the ability to be reached at any time .
Communication is readily available in cars and on the streets now .
People are able to use their car phones in case of an emergency , such as if they are stranded or broken down .
They can take their cellular phones on vacation and to their friends ' houses if they are expecting an important call .
To me , it is a bit ridiculous , but lots of people feel like they need easy access to a phone .
Another way the cellular telephone has affected people 's lives is the increase in the accident rate of people who are talking on their car phones .
When someone is concentrating more on their telephone conversation and less on their driving , they are more likely to get into an accident .
This sentence is already correct and does not require any changes : '' This happens often when people are in heavy traffic and are not concentrating on the car in front of them .
So , cellular phones also have a negative aspect .
Cellular telephones are also quite expensive .
They are expensive to buy , install , and use .
Whether you are making a call from a cellular phone or receiving a call , it costs a lot of money .
Although most people who can afford to buy a cellular phone can afford to pay the bills .
The other day , I called my father in his office from Madrid . On his `` party line , '' he was able to connect my sister in Santa Barbara and my mother in Los Angeles on her car phone .
I find it truly amazing that it is possible to speak with four people at once , especially when one person is in Spain and another is in a car !
It is truly a mark of great advancement in technology .
Each year , a new amazing product astonishes me even more .
I am starting to wonder when we will have robots cleaning our houses and driving us around .
The scary thing is that it 's just around the corner !
My most memorable trip was to Hue with my family .
When I entered the university , my parents decided to gift me a wonderful trip .
I felt so amazed because my family had interesting memories together .
I had one week in the ancient city .
I visited many sights in Hue , such as the peaceful Perfume River , Trang Tien Bridge , Thien Mu Pagoda , and the like .
Moreover , I gained a clear understanding of Vietnamese history by visiting the beautiful tombs of the Nguyen kings .
Especially , I gained experience in making `` NonLa '' —a beautiful symbol of the Vietnamese people .
Hence , I learned about one of the traditional crafts in Vietnam .
Furthermore , I enjoyed many dishes with ethnic flavors .
Besides , I had dinner on an imperial boat and enjoyed Nha nhac cung dinh Hue .
It was recognized in 2005 by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I took pride in Vietnamese culture .
This was an excellent experience for me .
Through it , I 'd broaden my knowledge about its cultures , religions , customs , and the like .
Special , it brought me beautiful emotions and memories with my family .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing with reference to your advertisement in the Jornal da Madeira on Wednesday , 14th February . I would appreciate it if you could send me a more detailed description of your English course .
Could you give me information about the schedule , the number of students in a group , and the tuition cost ?
Moreover , it is important to me if the teachers are native speakers .
I am interested in joining the course , particularly at level B2 .
The original sentence `` Do you have any vacancies in the group ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Also , I would like to know whether you accept the results of my tests , confirming my knowledge , or if I will have to take the test at your school .
The original sentence `` I am looking forward to hearing from you soon . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The sentence `` Yours faithfully , '' is already correct as it is . It is a standard closing for a formal letter , typically used when the recipient 's name is unknown .
It seems like `` Nadya Razorenova '' is a name and does n't require correction . If you intended to provide more context or if there 's a specific issue with the name that needs addressing , please let me know !
My favorite sport is tennis .
In my free time , I like to watch plays from around the world on television .
When I was a child , I began to play tennis , but I broke my arm and did not continue .
I liked knowing about the life of a famous tennis player .
I admire a tennis player ; he is a top sports person .
His name is Roger Federer , the best tennis player in the world for many years .
He was born in Switzerland 36 years ago .
When he played in the finals , he always stayed calm and had a positive attitude .
He has been the best player since he was young . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The original sentence `` He has been playing tennis for 26 years . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
He is the kind of person who always plays to win .
He has built up a fortune of at least 100 million dollars , and he was the world 's highest-paid tennis player .
He has a beautiful family with four children : twin boys and twin girls .
He had a charitable organization to help the children .
His wife always follows him . I think that he is a great person and the best tennis player .
Network analyses in political and economic research : organizations and institutions .
1 . Basic network concepts :
Practical application .
Foresight of the development .
The original sentence `` 3 . Software for interdisciplinary research . '' is a fragment and lacks context . To correct it , we need to provide more information or integrate it into a complete sentence . Here is one possible correction : '' 3 . We developed software for interdisciplinary research to facilitate collaboration across different fields . `` This correction assumes that the sentence is part of a list or a report and provides a complete thought .
Interdisciplinary network theory can be applied in a number of research studies due to its strong empirical orientation .
Flexibility is achieved by adapting graph theory 's algorithm to a lot of issues .
As a first example , we adapt the methodology and tools of network analysis in the context of political networks to optimize the interaction of various international actors .
In the second case , we examine the results of network analyses of the university 's partnerships .
University identifies the key areas of its activity for its contribution to the development of the territory .
Over the past few years , our monarchy has gone from one scandal to the next , from one disaster to another .
The British public has been made to realize that the Royal Family runs just like any normal family , only with a lot more money .
Many people are now questioning the worth of even retaining the monarchy .
Not so long ago , people thought that our royals were carefree and lived ideal lives .
That way of thinking started to change after the disastrous marriage that brought Sarah Ferguson into the family.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
No sooner was she married to Prince Andrew than things started to go wrong .
Public scandal surrounded their relationship , and their breakup represented the start of a downhill run for the monarchy .
Yet again , only recently , with the announcement that Prince Charles and his wife Princess Diana have been given permission by the Queen to divorce , we have been shown that no family is perfect .
Their separation , of course , followed Charles ' affair with Camilla Parker Bowles .
So , people say that we should not have a monarchy where they all cheat on one another , and lots of people certainly think that Prince Charles has no right to become king .
Many people argue that we can not afford a monarchy , even though the Queen now pays taxes .
This was highlighted by the fire at Windsor Castle , for which the taxpayer had to foot the bill .
I personally feel that we should retain the monarchy .
They are our country 's heritage , and other countries envy us for our monarchy .
They give our country something to feel proud of . Who has never dreamed of being a Royal ?
About me '' is a phrase rather than a complete sentence . To make it a complete sentence , you could expand it with additional information . For example : Corrected sentence : `` Let me tell you a little about me .
Hi , I 'm Adal Reuterswärd , and I 'm 13 years old—14 in January .
I have two sisters : Siri , who is 11 years old , and Lotte , who is 2 years old and very annoying .
All of us were born in Danderyd , but we moved here when I was 4 , and we have lived here since then .
Before that , I think we lived in Sollentuna or something ; I 'm not sure .
I love skiing , which I do 2-3 times a week , sometimes 4 .
But only in the winter , of course . I also dance on Mondays , and then I do some practice at home , and I play the guitar .
Otherwise , I love to paint and watch a lot of TV shows , like Pretty Little Liars , The Vampire Diaries , Glee , and more .
All of them are American , so I 'm kind of used to it , and that 's what I like to speak .
My favorite is The Vampire Diaries ; it 's the most exciting . However , the next episode comes out , I think , on October third , so I have to wait until then .
I have visited Paris a couple of times , and I really like it there.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
My grandparents live there , but they are n't from France ; they just moved there .
I do n't know why ; it 's a nice place , I guess .
They moved there with my dad and their other daughter , my aunt , when my dad was about 14 or something .
My favorite books , I think , have to be all the Harry Potter series . I read them a couple of years ago , and after I read the first book , we watched the first movie , and then did the same with the second , and so on .
I 'm thinking of reading the books and watching the movies again because I barely remember anything .
But I remember thinking they were so exciting , and after I read the last book , I thought I would never find a good book again .
I read many books , but none quite as good as Harry Potter .
I like to listen to a group called Skyscraper , which consists of four boys from different places in Sweden , and I also like Lucy Hale , an actress from Pretty Little Liars who has released her first album .
My favorite song of hers is called `` Road Between .
I also like Ariana Grande , and I 've been listening a lot to her new album .
At first , transportation is a very important aspect of our daily lives . We will discuss the variety of transportation methods .
In the past , the only means of transport were riding horses , camels , and donkeys , as there were no mechanical means . However , riding animals was a safer means than those of today , as there was no vehicle exhaust to pollute our atmosphere , and the dung from these animals was useful as a fertilizer for farmland .
Transport evolved gradually , first reaching bikes and carts , and then progressing to cars with engines .
Today , people use engine-powered vehicles like motorcycles , cars , trains , and planes .
As well as this , these means are much faster than the previous ones , but they pollute our atmosphere .
As vehicle exhaust harms our hearts , affects our breathing , widens the ozone hole , causes a lot of noise , and creates traffic jams .
But people do n't concern themselves with these dangers ; they are concerned only with their luxuries and comfort . I think that no new means will be invented .
People have been satisfied with means of transportation like cars .
One of the most significant inventions of the 20th century relates to the speed at which information is now communicated throughout the globe .
In fact , all improvements in communication have had a profound effect on the way in which people live their lives .
If I were to choose the most frequently used and influential invention in the field , it would have to be the television .
Through television , news and information can be graphically displayed at the very same time that it is happening .
This simple fact has changed in many ways how we live , and in a way , it has and continues to shrink the planet we live on .
There are , however , several downsides to television , and , like all inventions , it can be used in a useless way .
Not even truly dealing with the amount of television that is watched by the average person , there are several other important ways that television has changed people 's lives .
One interesting development has been the use of television in wars . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The Vietnam War was the first time that U.S. citizens were able to really see what it was like to be at war .
This was one of the factors that led to many of the protests .
We are also able to see for ourselves what is happening around the globe , and this has led to public concern and effort , for instance , in Somalia .
Of course , radio was already able to transmit sound , but the coming of the picture has had even more significance .
The greatest effect that television has had is that it has made the dimensions of the planet smaller .
Gone are the days of unknown and unheard-of areas .
Television can bring any part of the world into your living room within a matter of seconds .
Corrected sentence : It is also a very influential and powerful device in that it is the easiest way to communicate with populations .
There are many who feel that it can be a harmful thing , and this is true .
It is also used in ways that can desensitize one 's sense of what is actually being portrayed , because the picture itself is not real .
Either way , however it is used , there is no doubt that it has been one of the most significant inventions of the 20th century .
The truth is , we are all different .
I ca n't speak for others , but in my experience , I would say it is a good idea to take a year off after high school .
First of all , because probably most of us do n't know what to do with our lives , or we just do what other people tell us to do , especially our parents .
Second , because it is healthy to travel , get to know new cultures , and experience new traditions .
But you can do other stuff like work , save money for college , or start a new business .
If you have already worked before , you will have more experience than others , which gives you an advantage .
You will become more independent and more conscious of life in general . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
The original sentence `` He had to escape as fast as he could . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The police alarm could be heard throughout the entire street .
So , he knew that the police were near .
Michael threw the knife he had in his hand into the bush in front of the house .
He ran faster than ever . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Suddenly , he heard some dogs barking .
At that moment , he started feeling really nervous .
He hid under a big car and waited there .
He was afraid and worried about what had happened . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
He did n't want to kill his ex-girlfriend .
The original sentence `` But Michael had no choice . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Anne broke up with him over something stupid and irrelevant .
The original sentence `` She deserved that . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
After a few minutes , he saw someone getting into the car where he was hiding .
If he escapes , the person will see him .
Before he could do something , the car started , and it was too late to leave .
Television is a subtle magic box that enlightens our lives .
From the screen , audiences can raise their awareness of events happening around the globe .
Corrected sentence : Or they can find themselves experiencing a spectrum of emotions that they might not encounter in their daily lives by watching different movies .
Truly , television symbolizes a dramatic advance in today 's entertainment .
Nevertheless , it can also be regarded as a form of education .
Nowadays , when people mention education , an idea comes to mind in which we sit in front of books with teachers or computers beside us .
Most books are an inch in thickness .
Corrected sentence : And each side of that is filled with black-and-white images followed by a colorless description beside them .
Corrected sentence : Only with our mind can we imagine objects or ideas described in it .
Televisions , on the other hand , offer a much more colorful learning experience with just a screen .
Items have been categorized according to their attributes .
Theories and models try to consolidate with each other to explain one of the variances in the world .
For television , however , objects can be presented in a real-life manner .
Audiences are able , through observation , to understand the variety of the surroundings from time to time , as well as the correlations between matters .
They are given the whole picture and process of our environment , not just a snapshot .
The lack of natural light in the workplace became a serious problem , as more people complained about their poor relationships with others at work and their poor performance . Therefore , using inadequate lighting is the main reason for these issues .
First of all , not using natural light in the workplace can , in a small but considerable way , deteriorate the health of the employees . This is because neon lights can affect the eyes and can also lead to headaches if they are used for a long period of time .
As a result of suffering from headaches , the workers have a higher chance of feeling nervous and anxious , and their performance at work might decrease .
Secondly , as a consequence of being in a bad mood , there is the possibility of a lack of cooperation and an inability to concentrate and focus on what needs to be done , which also affects productivity and the overall development at the workplace .
As a conclusion , there are many reasons to support the need for employees to have access to natural light while doing their jobs . The lack of natural light can negatively affect both people and productivity , so it should be taken into consideration , and a solution should be found to address the issue .
Hello , Jo ,
I 'm glad to hear from you .
I 'm really happy that you are coming here next summer , so we will be able to catch up .
The original sentence `` You must visit Venice , the city on the water . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
You should easily find backpacker hostels that are cheap and comfortable .
You have to walk or visit the city by ferry because cars and buses are prohibited .
After spending a week here , you should take the train to Florence , a beautiful city rich in magnificent buildings .

The word `` Love '' is already correct as a standalone word . However , if you intended to use it in a sentence , please provide more context or a full sentence for correction .
It seems like the sentence `` Silvia '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or the rest of the sentence so I can help you correct it ?
Fame is an asset for every celebrity . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Broadly speaking , being famous is being well-known , and much effort is used to achieve that popularity , to be recognized instantly on a TV screen .
It may seem that the image of a person even lives a separate life from the person who created it , but it is not actually true .
There are several reasons why the image overshadows its creator .
One is that usually the same actor represents the same character in a series of films , so that the actor blends with his or her character .
Also , sometimes a reversal of the situation occurs when an actor becomes memorable for a particularly successful role in a film or play and becomes associated with only that role .
In short , actors become associated with their roles , and it is not easy for them to change their well-known image even in everyday life .
Corrected sentence : Regarding other socially-oriented celebrities , other issues arise .
For politicians , maintaining a high profile is essential because they are known in conjunction with their actions .
As for journalists , it is essential to appear in their programmes to become recognizable .
Overall , these celebrities use their visual image as a brand for what they do . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
To sum up , the attention given to a celebrity is a good sign for him or her , and it means that this person truly is famous .
Regardless of their will , they would be pestered by some journalists , and their lives would also be in the limelight because it is what people want to know—that is how being a celebrity works .

Summer camps
44 Victoria AvenueThe sentence `` 44 Victoria Avenue '' is already correct as it is a proper address . No correction is needed .
The United States of America ( USA )
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to inquire about your summer camps in the USA .
I would be grateful if you could send me further information about them . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
In addition , I have a few inquiries .
Firstly , do you take school leaves ? I have recently finished school , and I would like to be an assistant teacher in an educational program in a developing country .
The original sentence `` Also , I am a babysitter . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I finished my training last year .
For this reason , I love children .
Corrected sentence : I am very patient and chatty with them .
For this reason , I would like you to let me get this job .
Moreover , I am practicing a few sports ; I am a really athletic girl .
I wonder if you could tell me when this job starts and finishes . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
In addition , another reason to choose me is that I have been working in a restaurant for two years .
For this , I hope you consider me for this job .
I wish you would take me .
Finally , please find my most recent CV enclosed .
The original sentence `` I look forward to hearing from you . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence `` Yours faithfully , '' is already correct and does not require any changes . It is a standard closing for a formal letter when the recipient 's name is not known .
The sentence `` Ynes Durán '' is just a name and does not require correction . If you intended to provide more context or if there is a specific issue you want addressed , please provide additional information .
Today , most people think that after-school sports clubs are necessary .
However , it is connected with both advantages and disadvantages .
I present it in my essay . ( This sentence is already correct , but if you want to maintain consistency with the other examples , you could change the tense for clarity or context . ) Possible corrected sentence : I presented it in my essay .
I ask my young friends their opinion on after-school sports , and some tell me that it is good , while others say no .
In the first place , I must say that when young people take up sports , they are certainly healthier , more athletic , and of course fit . So , if you want to be fit , you should take up sports .
Disadvantages of playing sports include , for example , that if you get injured , you ca n't be active , and your weight might increase quickly .
Secondly , when you are exercising or playing , you have an adrenaline rush and feel excited , so you are self-confident , and it surely affects your relations with other people .
Unfortunately , you have a shortage of time to study because you spend time at the gym or pitch .
Another important aspect is that you will be the person who ensures a good team spirit , but also , when you are in a team , you sometimes can argue .
All in all , I still think that after-school sports clubs are a good idea .
In my class , most students say that sports are great .
Healthy and young people .
Young people are less healthy now than twenty years ago , according to studies that have recently appeared in newspapers .
One reason for this is that young people prefer to play video games rather than play outdoors because it 's more popular , or , for example , because they are n't used to playing football with their parents in the street .
Besides , young people eat too much junk food , and they 're less willing to do sports that require more effort .
If I were a politician , I 'd encourage people to exercise outdoors , and I 'd build sports centers where you would n't have to pay .
In my opinion , junk food should be more expensive so people would n't buy so much .
When you start doing exercise , you soon feel better and you ca n't stop .
Kaplan 's outside area
Introduction .
The purpose of this report is to discuss how Kaplan College should spend a large amount of money to improve its outdoor area .
Build a garden .
Every Kaplan student knows that behind Kaplan 's building is an unused space where the college could invest in building a nice and beautiful garden .
This place is not useful for everyone , so it would be awesome to invest in a garden , which all the students could use to relax during their free time .
The phrase `` Food and Drink '' is already correct as a title or heading . If you are looking to use it in a sentence , you might consider expanding it for clarity . For example : Original phrase : Food and Drink Corrected sentence : The event will feature a variety of food and drink options for all attendees .
The College needs to invest in some nice and healthy restaurants surrounding Kaplan , because many students have been complaining about the food and drinks they have to buy at school or in the surrounding area .
I heard a student saying that around Kaplan , there are only junk food restaurants .
They should spend on some nice , healthy , and cheap restaurants in the area outside of Kaplan .
Could you please provide the sentence that needs correction ? It seems like the sentence is missing .
I recommend spending a lot of money to build a garden and some good restaurants around Kaplan College .
These improvements would increase the quality and behavior of students ' work .
These would have a beneficial effect on all students . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Personally , I think people 's lives will change no matter what we do . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The original sentence `` And there is nothing we can do about it . '' is grammatically correct and does not require any changes . However , if you want to integrate it more smoothly into a larger piece of writing , you might consider removing the initial `` And '' or connecting it to a preceding sentence . For example : '' There is nothing we can do about it . '' Or , if it follows another sentence : '' We have tried everything we can think of , and there is nothing we can do about it .
But what we can do is decide whether that change will be for the best or not .
Sounds very easy and simple , but it is not .
We do n't make changes ; changes are the result of the decisions that we make and the consequences of our actions .
And one of the biggest changes that we can see nowadays is how blind we humans are to everything that surrounds us .
We go through our daily lives lost in our minds , thinking about expenses and personal issues , so we do n't take notice of what surrounds us .
We do n't notice other people , and we do n't communicate with each other .
Lost in our minds , in our cellphones , in our earphones , we disconnect from the world around us .
And this is a consequence of the bad use that we gave and give to technology , which fifty years from now will lead to another big change .
It 's like a vicious cycle .
Fifty years from now , people wo n't know how to talk to each other .
We will lose our social abilities .
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this report is to explain what the most important aspects of the environment in my city are .
The word `` BACKGROUND '' is not a complete sentence , so it can not be corrected in the same way as the other examples . If `` BACKGROUND '' is meant to be a heading or title , it can remain as is . If you intended to write a complete sentence , please provide more context or additional words to form a full sentence .
Treviso is situated in the north of Italy , and it was ruined during World War II .
Could you please provide the original sentence that needs correction ?
After being rapidly rebuilt and renovated , Treviso has become a modern city .
It is easy to reach by train , road , and air ; there has been an increase in the population thanks to the growth of industry , and all these factors have contributed to the worsening of environmental problems .
I 'm sorry , but the word `` DEVELOPMENTS '' is not a complete sentence . Could you provide more context or additional information so I can help you correct it ?
People interviewed at the front door of main public buildings such as the town hall and schools have stated that they feel , on average , happy about how the diligence has dealt with problems arising from the new aspects of the town , particularly regarding the following subjects :
Air , light , and noise pollution : about 80 % of citizens declared that they feel very satisfied with these issues because cars are not allowed to transit in the city center ; public lights are powered by solar panels , and moreover , the Mayor has signed an agreement with the Union builders that obliges them to create public parks in every area with 1,000 people .
Recycling : all families are provided with three litter bins in which they have to recycle rubbish , and at school , children are taught about the subject from primary school .
CONCLUSION :
Treviso can offer a high standard of life quality , and people are aware that the result of this aim is something to achieve together .
A historical place in Sweden , I would say , is the royal castle .
It 's in Stockholm , the capital of Sweden .
It 's big , beautiful , and contains a lot of history .
The original sentence `` The royal castle was rebuilt in 1697 after a fire . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
It was n't in use until 1754 , and it was n't finished until 1770 .
Since then , not much has been rebuilt .
On the inside , there have been some changes and modernizations to fit the royal family , and some painting on the facade on the outside .
Some museums have been added , and the royal castle is now a very popular tourist attraction .
I have personally never been there , but it would be interesting to go sometime .
An invention of the 20th century that I feel has significantly changed people 's lives is the introduction of bank cash machines , or automatic teller machines .
I can not comprehend how difficult it would be without the convenience of having access to money in emergencies or situations when money is needed .
It is also a convenience that helps to save time , which is very important to working men and women of the late 1900s .
This machinery also allows you to do your banking when you wish , rather than during the assigned banking hours .
People may argue that ATMs will take away employment in banks , but we must also focus on the positive aspects .
ATM machines appear in all areas of the world .
In the United States , for example , you can find machines in stores , movie theatres , parking lots at shopping malls , and at banks .
In many situations , I have either forgotten my wallet or not had enough money at the grocery store .
This is when I really appreciate my ATM card . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Another advantage of the card is that it reduces the danger of having large quantities of cash in your home or wallet .
This entices robbers and can lead to danger .
All in all , I feel ATM cards are an excellent invention . The convenience has proved itself in many circumstances , and I do not know what I would do without my card . The development of computerized technology has enhanced our environment by providing convenience and time-saving activities , which reduce the stress of our everyday life .
The Amazon lava lizards are pretty hard to see .
When you saw one , it probably had already seen you .
I noticed in the field that the big males are more conspicuous than the juveniles , the immature males , and the females .
The adult males seemed to always be in the same place .
However , I ca n't confirm that they were the same males in the same places .
The smaller individuals had a tendency to run away quickly when they noticed someone coming .
Also , they commonly return to the same place just after fleeing .
The lizards can stand still for a long time with few movements , usually involving the head .
The big ones showed more communicative displays , like head bobs and push-ups .
The boardwalk was the only point where I saw more than one animal that could interact with each other .
In other places , when there is more than one animal , they are away from one another and do n't interact .
The animals that use the boardwalk were more exposed than the animals at the other points .
The animals I observed among the vegetation were usually sheltered either by dense shrub or bush vegetation , or on a bromeliad leaf that had spikes on the edge .
The distance to cause flight in these animals was greater than that of the boardwalk lizards .
I feel like I should tell her the truth and beg for her forgiveness , '' Mark said to Michael .
Their friend Jenny was going to be out of town for a few days , and she asked Mark to take care of her cat while she was away .
He agreed to it , but he did n't really pay too much attention to whether the doors of his house were properly shut , so the animal escaped .
Jules is nowhere to be found , '' he sighed .
I 'm just going to buy her a huge bouquet of flowers and hope she does n't take it too hard .
Michael , however , thought his friend was overreacting .
I 'll fix this for him since he 's too stupid to fix it himself , '' he thought .
He went into the first pet shop he found and bought a Siamese cat , which he thought looked identical to the one entrusted to Mark .
Dear Jenny , I 'm sorry I 'm having Jules delivered to you , but I 'm busy and ca n't drop him off myself .
Love , Mark , '' he wrote on the card accompanying the cat cage .
The next day , there was a loud thumping on the door . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
It was Mark , and he was furious .
Did you really think that Jenny would n't notice that it was n't her cat ?
The original sentence `` And how dare you use my name on that card ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Now , she does n't want to talk to me ever again ! ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
And neither do I ever want to talk to you again ! '' he shouted as he quickly made his way off the porch .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
A film I want to recommend for our student club is `` Captain America : The Winter Soldier . '' It has a lot of adrenaline and emotions .
This film was launched on the 13th of March , and it was a big success .
Using the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) is popular in the modern world , although GPS does not work well in areas where the signal is interfered with .
Consequently , indoor navigation with GPS is not that good .
This paper aims to propose an alternative method to GPS for use in indoor environments .
The methods developed in this paper use only the position of the Wireless Access Points ( WAPs ) and the signal strength ( RSSI ) recorded by the user in order to calculate the position of the device .
Since today 's computers and cellphones contain all the required hardware , a future adoption of these methods would not only be easy but also cost-effective .
One of the methods proposed in this paper usually gives the user a position that is off by about five meters .
Therefore , this method can not be used when a more precise estimation is needed .
However , a weighted average of these three methods , together with different similar methods , might enhance the accuracy .
At the beginning , it is worth thinking over what the phenomenon of shopping is .
Some people claim that doing shopping delivers them a lot of pleasure .
Recently , I met a woman who maintained that spending money helps her to calm down .
Yes .
In my family , there are five people : my dad , mum , older sister , and younger brother .
All of them always talk , share , and support everything for me .
They are not only my family members but also my best friends .
When I was a child , my dad or mum usually took me to school by motorbike . I have beautiful memories of those times .
They bought me all the nice things that are useful for studying and made me interested in studying .
When I got a bad score , they did not blame me . Instead , they always said , `` We count on you . '' Thus , I never felt scared or worried whenever I did something wrong , and that made me confident .
I often told them my story before going to sleep , such as how I made friends with a boy in class , how I got over a dog on the road , etc .
But after growing up , I was not so close with my parents . I had many outdoor activities with my siblings , such as exercising and traveling .
In that time , we got over all problems and came to understand each other better .
So now I am overseas , and I always think about my family as my best friends ever .
Hi , dear Hanna ,
Last summer , I worked at the cinema . It was a very good experience for me , and I enjoyed it so much because I met a lot of people from different countries and cultures . I worked there for about three months , and the pay was satisfactory . At the cinema , I learned the names of many films that I had n't heard of before . My colleagues were very kind and friendly , and even after we finished our jobs , we remained good friends and spent time together going out for drinks and sometimes for dinner .
I hope to do the same job next year because I love it and hope to do it again .
In the future , public transport will no longer be required as `` owning your own vehicle '' becomes very common .
The justifications behind this are :
The advanced technology reduces the costs of manufacturing and maintaining an automobile to a very affordable level .
It seems like the sentence `` 2 . '' is incomplete or missing context . Could you please provide more information or clarify what you would like assistance with ?
Recognizing transportation as a necessity in daily life , the government will provide subsidies to residents who can not afford to own a car .
Under the future social welfare scheme , a person earning an annual income below a specific threshold will be provided a car at no charge ; in addition , all related maintenance costs such as gasoline , parking , insurance , and tuning will be reimbursed by the government .
There is no need to get a driver 's license to operate a car .
With the assistance of advanced global positioning system technology , we can simply input the place we would like to go to , and the car will automatically take us there with ease .
When will the day of `` no public transport '' come ?
We can not tell at this moment , but one thing is for sure : technology keeps changing our life and mode of living .
The airport in my city is not very far from my home , but at the same time , it is not easy to reach from the city .
The more comfortable way is to have a private car , with which it is possible to take the highway and then head towards the center of the city .
My home is close to the central rail station and the most important bus stop in the metropolitan area .
As a second option , there is a railway service from the airport to a secondary rail station .
Here , you have to get off and then take a bus , number 25 , which makes it possible to arrive in the center of the city , from where I can reach my home on foot .
Another possible option is to use a taxi service , but in this case , the cost of the journey is the most expensive of all .
The two best choices to return home from the airport are to use a private car or the railway airport service , which is very cheap . I spend a bit more time and money , but the journey is as nice and comfortable as the same trip with a private car .
I am a tall , blonde girl who loves all sports , but my favorite is basketball .
I enjoy this sport because it is very dynamic ; it teaches me many things such as being polite and very responsible , and above all , it is a group game , and I love working as a team .
I would like to give one piece of advice to someone who wants to start practicing this sport : always work as a team . Do not only think of yourself ; always think of what is best for the team .
The doorbell rang .
When I opened the door , imagine my surprise at seeing that my brother 's foot was covered in blood .
I was really upset . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The original sentence `` He came in , and I helped him . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
I told him that he must go to the hospital to take care of his foot , but he did n't listen .
He was afraid that if he went to the hospital , our parents would find out about it .
I asked him how this happened , and he told me that he fell off his motorcycle .
That 's when I realized what was going on .
He did n't want our parents to know because his godfather had just bought him the motorcycle , and our mother was against this . However , he did keep it on one condition : that he would be really careful .
I told him that we had to go to the hospital , even if that meant that our parents were going to take his motorcycle away .
He understood that he had no choice , so he agreed .
I called my mum and told her everything that had happened .
She came over to our house and took my brother to the hospital .
I was really worried , but thankfully everything was alright .
The pie chart depicts the different proportions of fuel types used to generate energy in Florida in 2007 , compared with the forecast for 2017 .
Overall , it is clear that natural gas is the main energy generator for both years , while renewables and oil come at the bottom of the list .
For example , the energy generated by natural gas increased from 38.8 % in 2007 to 54.4 % in 2017 .
Next comes the energy production by coal , which accounted for 29.3 % of the energy market in 2007 , followed by a drop of 5.6 % in the forecasted year of 2017 .
As for nuclear energy , although it represents the third-largest energy generator in Florida for both compared years , the trend is upwards , reaching 15.9 % in the estimated period .
In contrast , there is a significant drop in energy production for both oil and other sources in the two separate years , from 6.7 % to 1.1 % for the former and from 11.1 % to 3.4 % for the latter .
As for the renewables , the decrease in fuel generated over the period is less dramatic .
There are some reasons to explain why Venus shines so brightly according to the text .
In addition to these reasons , the passage provides information about Venus 's temperature , and the listening passage can refute some information that is expressed in the text .
Some questions are asked during the listening to expand the information about this planet .
How can Venus be so hot if it is covered by thick white clouds ? It should be cold , should n't it ?
There is another doubt about this high temperature : there is a planet closer to the sun that is hotter than Venus , so it is n't hot because of its location .
The most amazing question is : How can it be hot in a place where sulfuric acid prevents the sun from getting in ?
The listening passage could link the information in the text , stimulate some questions , and also provide the answers to make the reader more curious about the topic .
There are many problems facing both road and rail transport in the UK .
The most talked-about issues concerning roads are probably congestion and safety .
Congestion is most apparent around the major conurbations such as London , Greater Manchester , and Birmingham .
The simple way to solve this problem would be to either build more roads or make the existing ones larger .
However , this , as seen in recent events , for example , Newbury , has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents .
Another way to reduce congestion , especially in large cities , could be to persuade people not to use their vehicles at all .
Introducing schemes such as the 'park-and-ride ' scheme and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number of cars on the road .
Safety is often discussed as a priority factor concerning roads .
Too many accidents occur because of dangerous driving on busy roads.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
There are several ways to combat this problem . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased , lowering the limit by several units would deter many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use public transport .
Increasing the amount of law enforcement could also be effective , giving the police more rights to make arrests , increasing the number of speed cameras , and possibly giving larger fines .
Cutting down on the national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care .
The condition of roads is often a local issue rather than of national concern .
It is therefore up to the local council to maintain their roads better , especially in winter . The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Corrected sentence : This may require the local council to obtain more money from the government .
The original sentence `` Safety is much less of a factor for rail transport . '' is already grammatically correct and clear . No correction is necessary .
Here , the major talking point is efficiency .
It is often noted that trains are delayed and rarely run on time .
Because of this inefficiency , many of rail 's customers are turning to other forms of transport—cars mostly—but for long-distance journeys , flying is an increasingly attractive option .
A large amount of blame for this inefficiency goes to the actual trains , which are in most cases out of date and slower than modern ones such as the French TGV or the Japanese 'bullet ' train .
The train tracks can also be blamed , as they are often in a state of disrepair , and this inevitably delays trains .
It is hoped that the recent privatization of British Rail will bring in more up-to-date trains and increase the overall efficiency of traveling by train in a bid to attract many more customers .
The author in the reading part thought technology brings us a more comfortable life .
The author provided examples : first , we do n't have to eat raw meat nowadays because someone discovered how to use fire ; second , we do n't have to live in caves anymore .
However , the professor disagrees with the author .
She thinks technology does n't always make us better ; on the contrary , it makes us worse .
She said technology leads to weak relationships with family and friends .
And then it even makes our situation worse because it causes a lot of pollution .
Finally , the professor suggests that we have to reduce our use of technology .
If we reduce using it , we will have a good relationship and a better environment .
Apparently , the author did n't notice the bad influence of technology .
In this essay , I will put forward and briefly break down the controversy involving problems related to zoos .
As a controversial topic , it has arguments for and against it .
Depending on the point of view that each person might take , the argument they will give may vary .
It is very likely that animals in zoos suffer from not being in their natural habitat , being stared at almost all the time , not having the space they require to live comfortably , and lacking the natural peace they need to thrive .
Furthermore , it is important to note that these animals naturally live in groups , but in zoos , their numbers are limited to just a few .
Nevertheless , for society and especially for children , it is very useful to have the opportunity to visit a zoo .
If it were not for the zoos , it would be practically impossible for the majority of the population to know about wild animals .
Corrected sentence : The experience provides a wide range of possibilities not only for children but also for adults , such as veterinarians , scientists , and even anthropologists .
All in all , it would be difficult to find a fair solution , or even to provide a solution that would address both opposing sides of the topic in question .
In my personal opinion , I reckon Safari parks would be a solution in the middle of these opposing sides ; they would provide a better quality of life for animals and would be educational as well .
Firstly , what is the European Union ?
It seems to have two distinct forms , of which one seems to worry the British public most : Political Union , followed by Economic and Monetary Union .
In fact , these issues have become so heated in Great Britain at present that they have led to many disputes within the current government .
They also appear to be one of the major reasons for Mrs. Thatcher 's resignation .
In losing her , have we not already lost a part of our sovereignty ? The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Europe is forcing change upon us as we have been attempting to stand back , `` not letting socialism in by the back door , '' instead of playing an important role in positively affecting the decision-making processes in the European Community .
Great Britain can not afford to play a minor role in a two-speed Europe , especially during the current recession , and this has manifested itself in top governmental disputes .
So , a loss of sovereignty seems inevitable , whether we like it or not . The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
On monetary and economic union , I do n't feel that we have much to lose ; in fact , on the contrary , I think that we would benefit enormously , especially in light of 1992 .
If only the issue were presented in a more positive light , perhaps with some modifications , I am sure that the British public would agree .
After all , how long has it been since we lost our sovereignty to the follies of the international stock exchanges of New York , Tokyo , and Frankfurt ?
Will losing our sovereignty to Brussels or the Bundesbank make much of a difference ?
Did n't the `` Big Bang '' in October 1987 send shock waves worldwide with share prices plummeting ?
World processes are continuously becoming more and more interlinked , the effects of which often see no physical borders .
I therefore see this European unity as a natural process in world development , something that should be facilitated rather than hindered .
Can we really afford to play for time by dragging our feet ? ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The issue of political union is still more disputed .
Yes , we have a Queen , and what would happen to her ? Would she be forced to abdicate and be succeeded by King Jacques Delors ?
This is a very typical , misinformed , and ignorant statement posed by certain British `` patriots '' .
There are five other monarchs in the European Community , and their statuses , to a great extent , will not be greatly affected by any such union .
But there is a true cause for concern about Brussels ' bureaucracy , which rightly worries the British public .
This situation must be changed to eliminate the Council 's secrecy and transfer greater power to the European Parliament for a more democratic system .
This will mean that everyone will have a fair say in what goes on—something which must be guaranteed for such independent thinkers as the Britons themselves .
An answer to Britain 's reservation on European Unity , which I find most plausible at present , is a Federal Union that would ensure decisions , where possible , are taken at local levels .
This , if properly carried out , would enable us to keep our cultural identity—the ultimate element of our sovereignty .
Dementia is a common disease among the elderly population .
And it is difficult to be cured by humans , so robotics are used to help them .
For this case , at this moment , research reported that :
Social commitment robots are designed to promote therapeutic interactions through engaging activities and personalized communication .
Communication and social interaction .
The therapeutic use of the robots attempts to ... [ Please provide the rest of the sentence for a complete correction . ]
Reach out to people affected by dementia and provide an alternative mode of support .
Engagement with this population .
( Mordoch et al. , 2013 , p. 15 )
Consequence , these robotics offer the benefit to patients who are associated with personal interactions , enabling them to be pleased and relaxed .
Especially in Japan , there is a keen interest in using robotics to care for the aging population . The reason for this is that home care facilities or hospitals can not allow animal-assisted therapy to enter .
Unlike in Japan , in North America , people prefer to use animal-assisted therapy , but the use of robotics is less common than the use of animals .
I 've been a member of the Active Leisure Club since 7th April 2013 , and I 'm really pleased with your letter because it means that you care about your customers .
What I really appreciate is the staff 's qualifications , particularly in the fitness courses , and their punctuality .
This aspect is very important for working people .
I have to congratulate you on the cleanliness of the environment : everything is always perfect , and I often see showers being sanitized . People also have respect for all common spaces .
The original sentence `` I also have some suggestions . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
It would be really useful to have some hairdryers in the locker rooms ; in this way , people could have a complete service and could arrive home relaxed or ready to go out .
Another service that could make you competitive with other centers would be having a massage room . After any sport , it would be nice to have a personal masseur who takes care of your tired body !
Anyway , I 'm really glad to have a leisure club in my city that helps me keep fit !
Thank you for your interest .

Mary James and I met at Marianista School .
We went to secondary school together and have been friends for 5 years , so we know each other very well .
When Mary was at secondary school , she proved herself to be a brilliant student .
She was not only competent but also hard-working , and that was reflected in her high grades .
Nevertheless , she was not boastful ; on the contrary , she would help other students who had difficulties with the subjects .
She was appreciated by students and teachers for her kindness and willingness to help .
Mary is extremely loyal to her friends.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
She is also caring and supportive , and she knows exactly what to say when you are going through a tough situation .
Moreover , she is a very enthusiastic and energetic person , and whenever she sets an objective , she accomplishes it .
When Mary was a student , she was very self-demanding , wishing to do everything perfectly , and as a result , she was sometimes overwhelmed .
However , as years went by , she managed to handle those situations , as she learned how to organize and do her tasks in a more efficient way .
Mary was always interested in British culture ; therefore , she has studied English for several years and has read many books about Great Britain .
As she has finished high school , her intention is to pursue a career , and she is looking for an opportunity that would enable her to achieve her goal as well as develop her English-speaking skills .
It is clear that the post you are seeking to fill would undoubtedly suit her , and I have no hesitation in supporting her application .
The sentence `` Yours faithfully , '' is already correct . It is a standard closing for a formal letter , typically used when the recipient 's name is unknown . No correction is needed .
The name `` Jeni Jackson '' does not require any grammatical correction . If you are looking for a different type of correction or context , please provide more information .
Would you like to find out the best place for our final dinner ?
Firstly , we must look for a restaurant that is suitable for groups , as we are a large number of people .
If we go to a normal restaurant , we will dislike the treatment .
I am sure there are some restaurants we could go to .
I am going to explain what my favourite is for this special occasion .
I suggest 'Pomodoro ' .
This is an Italian restaurant located in the city centre .
Both characteristics are very important to me .
First of all , most people like this kind of food , such as pizza or macaroni .
Also , the location is perfect because we can easily arrive , either by walking or by bus .
After dinner , we may go to some discos or pubs .
Besides , this restaurant has delightful decor .
It seems you are sitting in a Roman theatre .
The waiters are from Italy , so they can talk with us in Italian , which would be very useful for practicing this language .
In conclusion , I would recommend this restaurant . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
It is the ideal place for us : a big place , delicious food , and the location , of course .
Nowadays , film stars , musicians , politicians , and models live in the limelight .
Some of them want it , and some of them are less enthusiastic about being the center of attention .
Journalists often follow them .
In my opinion , celebrities have a right to a private life , but only as long as they do n't share everything about themselves in the tabloids .
First of all , everyone has a right to privacy .
Being a famous artist or politician is an unusual job , but it 's still only a job , and after the job , everyone wants to have their own life .
On the other hand , being a superstar makes it almost impossible to have a private life .
Well-known people are frequently in touch with their fans , and most of the public knows them very well .
In my point of view , everyone has a right to privacy with no exceptions .
Journalists who follow the celebrities just cross the line .
The paparazzi often exceed the limits of privacy .
We do n't have to know everything about them , for example , the hair condition of some actress when she was shopping .
Superstars also deserve to have their own lives ; no one deserves to be followed or spied on .
Colombia 's army is a good example for other armies in Latin America and even for other armies around the world .
Even so , many Colombians do not know that the hard work of their soldiers , day by day , must be done for the sole purpose of protecting our lives and guaranteeing democracy for all of us .
Therefore , it is necessary to know why Colombia 's army has this distinction .
First , the military forces of Colombia have 438,700 personnel , making it the largest army in Latin America , followed by Brazil .
On the other hand , the Colombian army is regarded as one of the best in the world due to its internal conflict , which keeps the soldiers in action and constant training . In fact , Colombia trains other Latin American armies , as well as those from Africa and the Middle East , because of its 40-year experience in anti-terrorist warfare . The Colombian armed forces have been strengthened in a masterly manner through their preparation , intelligence , and modern tactical aids .
Second , it is necessary to highlight some of the work performed by our army in the anti-terrorism struggle , such as foiling terrorist attacks , neutralizing explosive devices left in urban and rural areas , preventing the recruitment of children , organizing medical brigades to help farmers , and most importantly , offering their lives if necessary to protect each and every one of us , even without knowing us .
Finally , I could say that the hard work and the good image of the Colombian army just reflect our wish to live in peace .
Likewise , all the Colombian people want to reach their dreams in a peaceful way , without weapons or fights between brothers , and thus show the world that the Colombian people are brave enough to fight for peace .
Dear Paul ,
What 's up ?
Sorry I did n't answer your letter earlier .
I was really busy because of organizing the next concert .
By the way , your VIP tickets are waiting in the drawer of my desk .
As you asked me , I 'll write you something about helping with Kokon 's concert , which took place last month .
It was a huge challenge for me because I was responsible for almost everything . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Just at the beginning , I had a problem with the owner of the pub .
He was n't convinced that we 'd be able to sell enough tickets to pay for the pub .
He did n't know the band and was really skeptical about it .
But you know , where there 's a will , there 's a way , and at last , I won him over .
When he came to the pub an hour before the concert to see how things were working , he was just speechless with surprise .
His pub was full of people , as never before .
I did n't tell him that even though Kokon is quite an underground band , it has so many fans !
His facial expression almost killed me when I saw it .
It was a mix of outrage because of the crowd in his pub and happiness because of the money they spent on beer .
Corrected sentence : And how about the concert ?
It was incredible .
Although I had to take care of everything , I could have a great time too .
We are planning the next events with Kokon 's leader .
I 'll let you know about the concerts coming up this month .
Just tell me when you are going to come back to Bytom .
The sentence `` Kisses , '' is already correct as a closing in a letter or message . If you are looking for a more formal closing , you might consider alternatives like `` Best regards , '' or `` Sincerely , '' depending on the context . However , if `` Kisses , '' is the intended tone , no correction is needed .
The sentence `` Wydra '' is incomplete and lacks context . To provide a corrected sentence , more information is needed . If `` Wydra '' is intended to be a name or part of a larger sentence , please provide additional details or context .
She started her life with so many problems , and after every period of sadness , she discovered that she had enough capability to continue .
But the most difficult thing from her perspective is when she is exposed to losing someone . However , even though she has lost many people in varying circumstances , she has never gotten used to the feeling of loss , and she experiences pain each time as if it were the first time .
She experiences traveling and attempts to leave behind everything that causes her sadness . She tries to keep away from politics and remove the images of the military and weapons from her mind , but the bloodshed of humans continues to haunt her .
She was writing about each important event .
I think that nowadays most people use public transport less .
I understand that the car is more comfortable and safe for travel and making short trips ; however , it is more dangerous for the environment .
People in some countries use different modes of transport , such as bikes or trains , to get around the city .
Scientists around the world are investigating genetic manipulation for a wide variety of beneficial purposes .
Genetic engineering is , however , a very controversial issue , and there is a lot of resistance to this work , especially regarding the suggestions of using it on humans .
The trouble is that although a scientist may think he knows a lot about a particular area of study , and indeed he may , there is still so much that we do not know about areas of study like genetics that there is a great fear of the unexpected .
And indeed , this fear is justified .
When we consider the horrific effects of a nuclear holocaust , I am sure there are many who wish it had never been discovered .
But are we right to blame the scientists who first started the research and who had no idea it would be used as a weapon ?
We can argue that surely the scientist must have the greatest realization of the uses of the discovery , good or bad , since he is the expert on the subject .
The original sentence `` But are we right to blame him ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Let us consider that he discovered a cure for cancer as a result of genetic engineering .
It is against human nature to stop at this stage and ask , `` Should I introduce what could be the greatest medical discovery of our lifetime when I am not 100 % sure of the consequences ?
Can we expect a scientist to bear this additional burden for the whole world ?
In truth , no , it is unreasonable .
Genetic engineering is developing rapidly and has already been used extensively in plants and bacteria , notably for the production of resistant strains of plants and in the production of human insulin .
The natural step forward now is to apply this knowledge to treating common genetic disorders like Down 's Syndrome .
There is a lot of resistance to this , and fears that we may manufacture mutants or that somebody may produce an army of superhuman clones .
Some of these may seem a little far-fetched , but it is conceivable that in 100 years ' time , we may be able to decide the characteristics of our child , whether he is a great piano player or sportsman .
It does not seem morally right to be able to make these decisions , and certainly , to anyone religious , it would be seen as interfering in the ways of God and something to be avoided at all costs .
A great scientist can not see into the future.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
He can not gauge the moral repercussions of his discovery , nor the long-term effect it is going to have on the world .
If he is doing research for what he considers to be a good cause , who are we to criticize him when we know far less about it ?
Provided a scientist 's work has been permitted and is public , I feel it is unjust to hold him responsible for what the world will make of his work .
To avoid continually writing he/she or his/her , the scientist in this essay has been referred to as he .
I hope no offense is taken from this .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
I am writing in response to the invitation to share my experience of making a hard decision that appeared in the July issue of your English-language magazine .
As a nineteen-year-old student , I have gained familiarity with this topic by deciding which course of studies I was going to choose .
First of all , I strongly believe that making choices is always risky , as people do not know what the exact result will be .
Like most adolescents , I was at a total loss when the time came to decide what I wanted to be in the future .
In despair , I applied for two courses of study that did not resemble each other at all , which made the moment of choosing a lot harder .
Knowing that not only was this choice a fundamental decision , but it was also one that would influence the rest of my adulthood , I appealed for help in deciding what I should focus on at the moment of making my decision .
As time passed by , I attended more and more classes .
I could not cope with such a busy timetable , and consequently , I was exhausted and stressed .
A decision had to be made before I dropped out of both courses of study .
I kept in mind the pieces of advice I was given and chose what made me happy , despite not having the approval of some of my relatives .
I am convinced that stark choices are unavoidable , but in order to not regret the consequences they might have , either positive or negative , people should choose what makes them happier .
However , I have not taken for granted that my decision will not make me regret it .
If this were the case , I know that I would always be on time to start again .
For the above-mentioned reasons , I think choices have to be carefully considered before being made .
Even though this does not assure the results .
The original sentence `` I look forward to following subsequent articles on related issues . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The phrase `` Yours faithfully , '' is typically used as a closing in a formal letter or email , and it is already correct . There is no need for correction .
It seems like the sentence `` Vilma Rossit '' is incomplete or lacks context . If `` Vilma Rossit '' is intended to be a name or a title , it might not need correction . However , if it 's part of a larger sentence or context , please provide more information so I can assist you better .
There are many standards by which success and hard work have been measured and rewarded in the past . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
In earlier times , people had the lifestyle of fending for themselves .
They were not afforded the many luxuries that have become commonplace in our present society . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Because of the differences in personalities and ambition , I feel it is vital that in today 's society , men and women should be financially rewarded for their individual efforts .
In a society , each person has the same basic needs for survival .
Long ago , the quest for the fulfillment of these needs took up the majority of each person 's day .
In order to feed your family , you had to plant .
In order to live , you had to build .
To have clothing , you had to sew it yourself .
Each hour of each day was devoted to meeting these needs.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Even in early times , the harder you worked , the more food , shelter , or clothing you gained .
This is a very simple example of reward equaling effort .
Bringing this to a more present time , we are now reaping the benefits of advanced technology , expanded knowledge , and modern times .
We have many machines to help us meet our food , clothing , and shelter needs with little or no effort on our part , it would appear .
People with great technical minds are using their talent on the job and paying someone else to do their manual labor .
However , just as in earlier days , the harder you work , the greater the reward . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Let 's imagine a society where all men and women are treated equally .
All basic survival needs ( and even wants , for that matter ) were provided regardless of the effort put forth . I would venture to guess that we would not be as advanced a society as we are today .
Competitiveness and jealousy would set in , and fights would occur .
Worst-case scenario : the world would become divided or even destroyed because someone was sitting on the sidelines and not doing their share .
We would not have the motivation to develop our talents and abilities and to use them in a way that benefits others .
Our society would become selfish and hoarding , and our culture would suffer .
It may be a pessimistic view , but I feel it is a very real view to say that we would become lazy and stagnant people .
The original sentence `` Life is about rewards . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
It is about learning where you are and how you can move yourself to the next level . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Each of us is measured daily by some scale of achievement.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Effort is vital to success ; motivation is the key to effort .
Some are content with their needs ; others want more—much more !
Our system of rewards is money , but is it really about money ?
I do n't think so .
It 's about meeting needs ( and even wants ! ) and how much one is willing to give for the opportunity to achieve something better .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
My name 's Ciprina Pires and I am 17 years old .
I 'm writing to you because I have seen the advertisement for a job at a summer camp in the USA , and I would like to apply for the position .
I like to work with children between 8 and 12 years old because they have energy for everyone and might understand some of the activities that we will be giving to them .
Normally , I like to organize activities for others that are interesting and different .
I love organizing evening activities more than the other ones because they are more exciting and more engaging .
Now , I have been cooking for my family and I love it , and I would love to cook for hundreds of people .
I can speak English well enough that everyone can understand . I 'm energetic , hardworking , and cheerful .
Please provide the sentence you would like corrected , and I 'll be happy to help !
The original sentence `` Yours sincerely , '' is already correct and does not require any changes . It is a standard closing for a formal letter or email .
It seems like the sentence `` Ciprina '' is incomplete or lacks context . Could you please provide more information or context so I can help you correct or complete it ?
The impact on modern biology was enormous , and for this reason , in 1993 , the inventor was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry .
For this invention , Mullis received a bonus of $ 10000 from the company he was working for , but in a short time , the rights to use the process made the company 300 million dollars !
The television is , for many people , the main way to spend their free time . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Children spend more than one hour a day watching television .
Parents are worried about what their children watch because they think that their sons do not learn anything ; it only entertains them .
It is far from reality .
If we choose the correct programs , they could teach us a lot inadvertently .
There are a lot of documentaries about the environment , animals , the human body , etc. , that are very interesting and entertaining .
Cartoons can be translated into English or other languages to improve them .
The TV can be used to leave the mind blank or fill the brain with a lot of useful knowledge .
Now the stone is on their roofs . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The original sentence `` Plastic bags are banned in the city . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The town council is planting more trees .
Corrected sentence : A solar heater has been introduced in the houses instead of a water heater .
A rainwater storage system to increase the water level .
Human waste is properly handled by the town council .
The government is encouraging people to use public transport instead of cars .
Using a bicycle is a more environmentally friendly vehicle .
LED lights were introduced to reduce electricity usage .
The original sentence `` Change is always good . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
It is widely accepted that change is an essential driver of progress .
In fact , for many people , without changes , mankind would still live as in prehistory , without fire , wheels , or even comfortable houses . We would live in caves , would n't we ?
We would only eat what our men would hunt .
We used to wear animal leather .
The original sentence `` Oh ! '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The sentence `` What a ridiculous drawing ! '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
But in my opinion , the problem is more complex .
Conservative people , for instance , are usually reluctant to change because , in general , they are afraid of change , probably because they prefer bad things that are certain over uncertain things .
In addition , if you glance at history , despite the fact that times of revolution are usually traumatic , humanity tends to improve afterward .
The question is whether the convulsions , violence , and wars that often accompany change are really worth it .
It is often said that public transport is bound to disappear , since most people seem to be pleased to use their own cars for nearly every journey they take .
This is likely true for the majority of people .
Sure enough , if asked , most people would say they prefer traveling by car to using public transport . Traveling by car offers many advantages .
For instance , you can decide exactly the time you want to leave and the place you want to leave from .
You do not have to share your journey with anybody if you do not want to , and you can get to the exact point where you want to be .
Everything about cars seems to be advantageous .
The original sentence `` So , why does public transport still exist ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
To begin with , not everybody can own a car .
But even if everybody could , it would be a nightmare to try to get to a big city , such as Barcelona , by car .
I do not think there would be enough space for so many vehicles , not only to park but also to circulate on the road .
Moreover , the level of pollution would be so high that I doubt anybody could survive .
The future .
The problems of this plant are increasing every day , and people ask themselves : What will the future be like in 30 years ?
We think that the world will be destroyed . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
At first , many kinds of plant species will have become extinct , and 90 % of fauna will be endangered .
After that , food will have become insufficient to satisfy society 's demands , and people will be dying of starvation . Diseases will be more common , and many people will have died due to epidemics .
An appreciable part of society will have been diagnosed with cancer . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Living in an egalitarian society , people will be collaborating to save the world . We will be using robots to clean the planet , scientists will be designing special clothes to avoid radiation , and people will be using oxygen tanks .
Living in our current society , which is divided by social status .
Poor people will be living in the trash , and rich people will be living inside spacecraft .
There will be wars over access to water .
Once you become famous , you will definitely know the taste and the price of fame .
There are many people in my country who keep thinking that being a famous person to some extent is a blessing .
Corrected sentence : Such a person is known to most people at a national or even international level .
Some believe that there are many advantages to being a celebrity or widely known person , though there are a number of disadvantages as well .
First of all , many local and world-renowned celebrities claim to have no private life .
Being famous means that most likely , journalists , your neighbors , and ordinary people will be interested in your life .
Most of the time , it is impossible to avoid this kind of attention.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
People are curious , and they admire their favorite stars ' lives by reading magazines , watching TV , or surfing the Internet .
Moreover , such yellow press columns with the title 'celebrities ' hit the sales records , giving huge benefits to the publishing companies .
Millions of people are able to buy magazines with celebrities on the covers , although some photos give the readers some `` additional '' and not the most pleasant details .
People are interested in almost everything : articles about break-ups , drug-abusing young celebrities , questionable relationships , or even the special ones with naked celebrity photos .
This is more than sharing some of your private life details ; most of the press people look for scandals , and their aim is to uncover the most intimate secrets .
Secondly , being successful and famous also requires a person to be good at their job .
The 'star ' is followed not only by the public eye , but he or she is also evaluated by producers and future employing companies .
There is no doubt that celebrities work hard to achieve fame , better and more desirable jobs , and supreme salaries .
The majority of celebrities have their personal managers , who take care of their image .
So even if you are rich and famous , it does not always mean that you will be able to live and act as you would like to .
Fame has another side : there are strict requirements for actors , singers , etc. , which appear when they sign contracts with the companies that provide their jobs .
Attending some events or parties may be a necessity and does not always depend on the wishes of a celebrity .
Also , it is said that fame spoils people and they struggle with their personal problems ; only it is even more difficult to help them than to help any ordinary person .
Sometimes there are cases when the lack of private life leads to more serious issues .
We all know that some well-known people become engaged in illegal activities , start using drugs or alcohol , and join some mysterious religious groups .
Sometimes they even become suicidal simply because they can not live under the constant pressure .
Even if being in the public eye is not always very pleasant , there are a number of advantages that make it worth sacrificing a little of your private life .
Going deep into the world of public entertainment , which is definitely rewarding , gives you a lot of benefits .
Most celebrities do not work all their lives , although the money they gain during their careers ( sometimes it is a very short period of success ) allows them to live without any worries .
Giving away some personal life details while you are famous may bring you fortune .
For example , many celebrities sell their newborn photos to magazines , as they offer enormous sums of money to get a tiny glimpse into their family life .
Moreover , being a famous person means that you are able to influence other people , especially younger generations .
By setting a good example , celebrities may become idols and inspire other people to live well and help others who are in need .
By donating money to charities and being involved with volunteering projects , you can make a difference when you are wealthy and famous .
To summarize , fame comes with many disadvantages , as well as a number of advantages .
The original sentence `` Celebrities have different experiences . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
Their lives seem to be glamorous , and they look gorgeous , though you will never know what is under the 'beautiful and sparkling cover . '
Shopping Online .
Currently , with the internet having penetrated our lives , shopping online enjoys great popularity among us , especially among young people .
Although some deny shopping online for the allure of the internet , I am unhesitatingly hooked on it .
First of all , we enjoy more convenience and time-saving by shopping online .
For example , time and space do not need to be taken into account when we shop online .
Since we want to purchase something , we can shop online . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
As is well-known , there is no shutdown at online stores .
In addition , walking for a long time and distance could be avoided if we shopped online .
Once we place an order , the merchant will dispatch the goods immediately .
Meanwhile , it 's easier to buy quality and inexpensive goods through the internet .
Thanks to the display of feedback from customers and the merchants ' reputation on the webpage , we can directly evaluate the goods and , to some extent , select from the vast range of products we desire online .
Finally , shopping online plays an essential role in our lives due to its convenience and flexibility .
In other words , shopping online really does perfect our lives .
I believe that it will be more wholesome and guaranteed with the optimization of the network market .
Dear USA Summer Camp ,
I want to have this job because I like children and being outside . Also , I am a person who works a lot , even at night if necessary .
I am very good at organizing activities suitable for children . Last year , I went to a campsite that taught me how to prepare activities for children and how to work with them .
Last year , I went to cooking lessons where I learned how to prepare food suitable for children . I also learned how to prepare desserts for both adults and children .
I 'm a nice , funny , and sociable person with children .
At the moment , public transport is used , but many people are starting to travel much more using their own cars instead of traveling with public transport , which , in my opinion , is better to use .
One reason for my opinion is that on a bus , train , or railway , we can fit more people than in a car or on a motorbike , so we pollute less because we all use the same vehicle instead of each person using one car or one motorbike , which would pollute much more . As always , things have a price , but there is a question that must be asked : is it worth paying to save our ecosystem or even our lives ?
I think so , and besides , it is much cheaper than buying a car and having to put petrol in it every month or less . Another reason I prefer to use public transport is that I have to adapt to a schedule , so I wo n't be late to the place I want to go . Besides , bus stops have codes that are used to see how long it will take for the next bus to come .
To conclude , public transport is much better than using a car or a motorbike , but people ca n't see it . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct , so no changes are necessary . )
Terrorism is the use of fear and acts of violence in order to intimidate societies or governments .
Many different types of social or political organizations might use terrorism to try to achieve their goals.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence `` It is difficult to define terrorism . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Terrorism has no official criminal law definition at the international level .
Common definitions of terrorism refer to violent acts that are intended to create fear ( terror ) , are done for a religious , political , or ideological goal , and target civilians .
Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war .
The use of similar tactics by criminal gangs is not usually called terrorism , though these same actions may be labeled as terrorism when carried out by a politically motivated group .
Best friends are meant to be forever . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
In that sense , family will be there for us forever .
But what if they are not that close to you ?
What if they keep you pampered always ?
Of course , you will feel irritated , especially during your teenage years .
Family protects us and gives care , but it can be irritating if they do the same when you grow up .
They should give you some space .
When you are a child , you love to be with your parents and enjoy hanging around with them . Once you move past your childhood , your focus shifts to friends , and you consider them your everything , while keeping in mind that only family will be there for you in the worst times .
I think they have changed since there are more and more fat kids by the day .
Portugal is one of the European countries with more overweight children , with a slightly higher number than Spain and Ireland .
Eastern European countries are the ones with fewer fat kids ; maybe it 's an influence of former communist rule ?
When you do n't have anything to eat , you do n't get fat and , consequently , you do n't develop diseases that are common in overweight people , like diabetes .
That 's the only , although unintended , advantage of communism over capitalism .
Although it would be amusing for me to continue to slag off communism , let 's not go there . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The topic is about eating habits , which are always eradicated , alongside health and prosperity , when communists gain power over countries .
The original sentence `` Bang ! '' is already correct as it is . It is an onomatopoeic expression or interjection that does n't require correction .
Nowadays , in my country , people eat a lot of the same unhealthy food that people in other Western countries eat .
We used to eat a lot of codfish , the stereotypical Portuguese food , and we still do , but now we also eat a lot of fast food , and that 's part of the reason we have so many overweight children .
When I was a kid , fifteen years ago , kids used to be slim .
When I entered the first grade , there was n't a single fat kid in the class .
Today , 32 % of kids are overweight .
In the time period of just twenty years , we became one of the countries in Europe with more overweight children .
So yes , eating habits have changed dramatically in my country , but we may get back our good old slim silhouettes after our—probably—new government , a coalition of socialists and communists , takes office .
Food—everybody loves it . However , some people hate it too—those who ca n't control themselves and suffer the health consequences of overeating .
Lack of self-control is a very sad thing .
Fortunately , I do n't have that problem . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I 'm lacking inspiration to write , but I will try because I have to .
Eating habits in my country vary widely depending on the region and cultural influences .
I already talked about the overweight children who eat unhealthy food that contributes to their weight gain .
Shitty food is trendy in my country , as I said , but that 's true for every European country , as I also mentioned .
But I guess it 's better than eating roots and animal corpses , like our hominid ancestors did millions of years ago .
Hunter-gatherers thousands of years ago ate roots too , but they did n't have to eat rotting flesh because they hunted animals , as the first half of their name suggests . I know I really look like an idiot by writing these kinds of things , but that only proves that I was telling the truth when I said I 'm lacking inspiration .
I 've been reading Milton 's * Paradise Lost * , first because I wanted to read it for its literary significance , and second because I want to improve my English , as reading it is a good way to achieve that goal .
I 'm only in the first book .
It 's an excellent work , of course .
I thought I would have trouble comprehending Milton 's English because , you know , it 's not English you hear from the average and contemporaneous English speaker , but it turns out it 's a much easier read than I thought .
I find Shakespeare harder , although with a bit of effort , I manage to understand it too , but not always , at least for now .
Dear 230-year-old me , I am only 15 now , and I have n't lived enough .
I am just a kid ; I am not complete yet . I have a lot to discover and to shape in my life .
I have no idea how I am going to get there . I am now in my bed studying for my tests for tomorrow , but I guess in 215 years from now , it wo n't matter .
I really wonder how it feels to live that long . Are n't you bored of living ?
The original sentence `` Do you ever wish you were dead ? '' is grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
I bet you have a God complex ; you must feel powerful ...
The original sentence `` But do you ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Or perhaps you feel weak , vulnerable , dead inside , lost ... You have lived for so much longer than anyone should .
Of course , living like this must have consequences . What is it like in your head ?
The sentence `` How do you look ? '' is grammatically correct , but it might not convey the intended meaning clearly . If you are asking someone about their appearance , you might want to rephrase it for clarity . Here are a few possible corrections based on different contexts:1 . If you are asking someone to describe their appearance : `` What do you look like ? '' 2 . If you are asking someone how they appear at the moment : `` How do you look right now ? '' 3 . If you are asking someone about their opinion on their appearance : `` How do you think you look ? `` The appropriate correction depends on the context and the intended meaning of the question .
The original sentence `` What do you think of yourself ? '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
Are you happy about what you have become ? ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
What have you done ?
The original sentence `` What is the price of being you ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence `` Did you really give up everything to have what you have ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The sentence `` Do you ever regret it ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence `` Do you feel lonely ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
What are you doing with your cold heart ? ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct , so no changes are necessary . )
Is there anything capable of unfreezing it ?
I dreamt of you , you know .
We were in a forest ; the sun was at the top of the sky , the birds were singing , and I could hear the sound of the water falling . It was a heavenly place ; it was beautiful . Then you were there , behind a tree . You did n't say a word ; we just got closer . You were looking into my eyes , and so was I . Then I put my right hand on your cheek , and in that moment , I felt you—your skin , your soul , your existence .
And it lasted for a few moments ; it was magical .
I guess we are going to meet only in one place , in Heaven ; we are not supposed to know each other on Earth .
Corrected sentence : Not in our miserable mortal lives ; it does not matter anyway .
I felt you in that dream , and I would not change it for anything .
The original sentence `` I felt close to you . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
And somehow , without even meeting you , I fell in love with your existence .
And it kills me tonight that I will always have love in my heart for you , forever .
I will weep for you , my love , day and night . Even when my eyes wo n't let my tears slip away , my heart will always do it .
Reckless , pretty , and wild .
I hated the teacher who was Clara .
She taught history in 2º E.S.O . She has short , curly brown hair .
The original sentence `` She always had a ponytail . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Clara was serious and bossy . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
She generally shouted at everyone when she taught a lesson .
Clara was worse than Pilar , my English teacher .
Pilar was kind and fantastic with children . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Valle del Ambroz '' School is a small place .
It 's a small building located in the center of the village .
Classes are small , and the pavilion is too .
The quality of teachers was good , although they explained things very poorly because the students were not taught very well .
I sometimes hated them because they did n't see the effort we put in to pass exams , even though we were so psyched for it .
The other reason why it was hated was that the exams were difficult , and they were also demanding .
However , I have a great memory of all my teachers because they helped me pull it off .
I 'm still dreaming that there will be a chance for me to make a trip around the world . There are many ways to travel from one place to another , but I prefer doing that on a boat or a train because on a boat or train , I can feel the wind on my face or hand . I can hear the sound of birds above me . On a plane , you can see only the blue sky and nothing more . It is a strange idea for me to be between the earth and the sky , so I prefer traveling by boat or train .
Not only does public transport have a future , but it also deserves a bright one .
Despite the fact that traveling by car may be more comfortable , we all should be absolutely conscious that public transport ought to occupy a prime spot in our future mobility .
Otherwise , the future of the Earth might be put in danger . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Indeed , if we , as a civilized society , were aware of the problem of greenhouse gases that are repeatedly expelled into the atmosphere , we would use public transport much more often .
In this way , air pollution would be reduced as a consequence of using buses , trains , or the underground—all of which are public means of transport that can prevent the massive presence of private cars on our streets and roads .
Apart from cutting down on polluting gases in the atmosphere , the safety of our roads would improve as there would be fewer cars circulating throughout the country .
Both effects would combine to offer a healthier environment in which our children could grow up safely .
On top of that , there is no excuse not to use public transport , as it has been remarkably improved over the last few years .
Nowadays , it is almost possible to access any place at any time by public transport , erasing , as a result , one of the main problems that public transport used to have for its potential users .
So , if we are determined to preserve our beloved planet and make it a better place to live in , a definite good start would be to leave the car in the garage and take the bus .
The last film I saw was not new ; in fact , it is `` The Others . '' It is the best horror and suspense film that I have ever seen in my life .
It is set on a small English island , and it is situated in 1946 when the Second World War ended .
A crazy woman is waiting for her husband .
She has the absolute obligation to protect her children because they are allergic to light .
Recently , three new servants appeared in the mansion : Bertha Mills , Mr. Tuttle , and Lydia .
Strange things happen in the mansion . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
At first , the little girl , Anne ( daughter of Grace ) , hears and sees these strange things , but her mother and brother , Nicholas , do n't believe her .
Anne always told her mother about the strange things she saw , and Nicholas started to do the same .
The time passed and everyone in the house started to feel these strange things .
At this moment , Charles ( the husband and father ) returns to the house , but one day he disappears again .
One day , all the curtains in the house disappeared , and this was serious because the children were sick and could n't receive sunlight .
I would recommend this film to anyone because the story seems to be real .
The movie has excellent sound effects and transmits epic sensations .
As we discussed before the project was launched , that two-domain structure causes some problems and inconvenience both in management/maintenance and in collecting analytics ( Google , etc . ) .
Thus , using a single-domain structure seems better if it is possible to develop the site in such a way ( in combination with WordPress CMS and custom code ) .
Now it 's time to draw the line at all the considerations and make the final decision ( with SCHEME included ) .
To ensure the relationship between members of the same species , the movements of the procession are specific to each , and the female selects the one that best suits her .
Both mates performed movements to show submissive behavior and reach copulation .
Before I start this pretty obvious presentation , I would like to share my own opinion : well-organized , good scheduling , and a wide-routed transport system is one possible way to move around the city .
So , the advantages of having a personal car are that you are sure of the strangers and you are the master of your route .
Avoid wasting time with several stops , and you can reach your goal ( workplace , shop , or even suburban ski club ) much more easily and quickly .
And the above arguments are against owning their own car—it 's expensive , not ecological , and requires taking care of the car ( parking , repairs , insurance , cleaning ) as well as finding a lot of money to buy one .
Thus , the flexibility or the price , this is the main question .
As soon as the problem of the price of owning a car is solved , the question of the necessity of public transport will be raised again .
Many people believe that the future of public transport is uncertain due to the incredible increase in sales of new means of transport , such as electric cars and bicycles .
For this reason , people wonder if normal means of transport could disappear due to this new transport trend .
In my opinion , I am completely sure that public transport is the best option for moving around the city for several reasons .
First of all , taking into account the financial crisis , public transport , like the bus or underground , is the cheapest way to travel or even move around in your own city .
Overall , if you add not only the petrol price but also the maintenance , services , insurance , and a few but expensive taxes , it becomes quite costly .
In addition , everybody knows that there are more people in a bus than in a car , so consequently , the pollution produced is less .
By contrast , it is true that many places do not have good communication and it could take you quite a long time to get there .
But imagine if everyone had a car ; nobody could arrive on time to work .
On balance , public transport is the best option for getting around the city .
But maybe , if communication between villages improved and bus timetables were better , public transport could be even better .
Since we had a lot of success with this invention , I started to have some fantasies about other high-tech portable inventions I could create .
I started imagining some type of synthetic textile or fiber that , when water touches the surface , does n't get wet .
This could be really useful for the military because sometimes they have to work in the rain , and their hands and body get wet , which is uncomfortable .
To do this , I had to alter the gravity of the water when it touched the surface so that instead of the material absorbing the water , it could reflect it .
At first , when I applied the chemical to the material , it became very rigid ; therefore , it was uncomfortable to use and had very little mobility .
I used a fraction less of that chemical to put it in the clothes to see the results of this minor change in volume on the secret substance I was using to make water have a reflection of a cloth for military and other various purposes , like using it on a rainy day and replacing umbrellas , which could make a difference .
If this invention were able to work , I could foresee a lot of success and money coming to me . I suspended the cloth again to apply the substance to see if this time it would work well . I could foresee that if my partners found out about my invention , two things could happen : they would be proud of me for starting to create and develop new innovative ideas that could make significant progress for humanity , or they could get really mad at me because I did n't tell them about my project . Since we are working on an ongoing project that is very successful , they could be very disappointed in me for trying to create something new while we are still growing the invention we created about six months ago with a lot of hard work .

There 's no future for public transport because traveling by car is so much more convenient .
When you travel by car , you can have more privacy , and you can go anywhere , anytime .
It 's more expensive but has a lot of advantages .
The public transport is good for the city , but personally , it is terrible ; you need to wait and there are n't many directions to reach your destination .
Corrected sentence : There is n't much comfort , and sometimes you have to go without a seat .
Many times , travel by bus is delayed and arrives crowded , which wastes time at every bus stop .
The people are different , and they are always different . No matter how much time passes , the people are different , and they like that .
Maybe the poor people have the possibility to buy a car as well , but if it costs a lot of money for them , they will still buy it .
It 's a question of freedom and a triumph for humanity .
No matter the improvements made to public transport , traveling by car was and will be the best choice for a future with more options that is not so rigid and compact , but flexible , fast , and convenient .
My favourite sport is yoga , which is a fantastic activity .
I like yoga because it is a relaxing sport , where we can work on our mind and our body .
Yoga helps to achieve greater flexibility and improve your concentration .
Yoga helps us to live relaxed and accept life as it is .
It allows you to work the organism by stretching techniques .
Yoga has many emotional , spiritual , and moral benefits that we should learn to take advantage of to better deal with the situations we face on a daily basis .
The advice I would give someone starting this sport is to relax and enjoy to the maximum what yoga has to offer you .
According to Lunde , 85 % of homicide victims are killed by someone they know.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Yes , statistics from SC do support this thesis . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
These tragedies illustrate the power of frustration on the human mind .
People who murder others probably did n't go into the situation wanting to kill the other person .
The person 's frustration led to anger and aggression that just got out of control . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Even small things , such as getting in the way of someone 's goal , can lead to frustration , which may result in the aggressive act of murder .
These tragedies also illustrate the flippancy with which we Americans view murder and other forms of violence.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Through exposure , perhaps we have become desensitized to violence .
The media also play a part in this flippancy .
When a character is shot , he often appears in the next scene .
Kids , in particular , are n't forming realistic schemas regarding violence.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
The media also desensitizes men to sex crimes , leading to more rapes .
We , as potential parents , must instill in our children—the future presidents , doctors , teachers , and even murderers—a true picture of aggression and the need to control it .
Racial prejudice is not as pronounced as it was 30 years ago.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
It actually appears to be declining .
This is evidenced in , for example , cartoons and TV shows—racial minorities are not publicly stereotyped .
Attitudes regarding desegregation have also changed—perhaps as a result of the psychology of inevitability and cognitive dissonance .
Perhaps through the media and other sources , some misconceptions are being cleared up , and more realistic information is being provided to the public .
I would suggest that he either focus on the similarities of ideas and opinions with that person or genuinely consider presenting his opinions and then converting to the others ' opinions .
He should also appear competent , but not perfect ( the pratfall effect ) . The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
He could initially pretend to think negatively of her and then gradually evaluate her more positively ( gain-loss theory ) .
The client should appear as attractive as he can without using his attractiveness to manipulate her .
The client can hope ( particularly if he is of average or lower attractiveness ) that she has moderately low self-esteem and will thus be less selective in her choices for dates or friends .
The client should also disclose personal information .
To induce the client to like him .
This advice can be backed up with research .
It would be better for the client to ask a favor of the person because , due to cognitive dissonance , the other person would view the client as being generally more favorable .
In discussing sensitivity , the author emphasizes the importance of being sensitive to one 's own feelings , thoughts , and the effects of one 's own behavior on others .
The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes : '' Only when this is accomplished can he become sensitive to others ' feelings .
Sensitivity is a necessary component of effective communication.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Confrontation can make one more sensitive to their own behavior and how others interpret it .
One should be sensitive to others ' interpretation of his behavior so that he will know better how to act .
Michael arrived home at 5:45 p.m .
He went straight into his room with an angry expression .
He sat down on his bed , screaming . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
After that , he began to smash his things . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
His mother heard the noise and decided to see what was going on .
She took the stairs and went into Michael 's room .
The original sentence `` She saw things lying everywhere . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence `` She asked him why he did it . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Michael , instead of answering , shouted at her .
He and his mother had a clash over something .
A while later , she left the room , leaving the door open . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
At that moment , Michael began to calm down .
He thought about what he had done and let out a sigh.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Genetic manipulation is an area that has caused a great deal of controversy within the scientific field , with a number of advantages and disadvantages .
One of the main advantages is the ability to tailor other organisms ' genetic makeup to suit human needs .
The possibilities are endless . A crop could be designed that would grow in the dry , hot conditions of many third-world countries , relieving them of their worries of starvation .
Cattle could be bred to be more efficient at converting plant energy to body mass , or diseases could be eradicated by altering people 's resistance to them .
Of course , to some extent , genetic manipulation already exists .
Racehorses are bred from certain combinations of parents , and gardeners cross-breed plants to suit their individual needs .
However , there is much opposition to the process of genetic mutation .
The advantages seem very favorable , and I 'm sure that a scientist would take much credit for them .
But would he accept the blame if he caused one of the many disadvantages of genetic manipulation ? The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
There are many possibilities for the misuse of this process . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
One concerns ethics and morals .
Is it right to try to change motive ?
The original sentence `` Is it the right of one man to play God ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
It is also possible that we might not be able to control the new organisms that would be created by genetic engineering .
A new plant that has an increased growth rate may seem like an answer to all our problems , but what would we do if it suddenly upset the ecosystem , drained the soil of its nutrients , and did not allow other plants to grow ?
In theory , a scientist should take responsibility for this , but in an area such as genetic manipulation , of which we do not know a great deal , it may not be possible to find a solution .
Another problem would be the process of testing . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
We are already near the stage where it is possible to test people 's genetic makeup to find the possibility of their developing certain illnesses .
Soon , it may be possible for firms to employ only people with a certain expected lifespan , or for insurance companies to refuse to insure certain individuals based on a genetic test .
Although the threat of the Cold War has diminished , the technology made available from studies into genetic warfare could be dangerous in the wrong hands , particularly in the area of germ warfare .
Although scientists can take credit for the developments and improvements in the quality of life that their research brings , there are so many disadvantages that they must also take responsibility for the misuse of this new technology .
I 'm so sorry for sending the email too late .
It 's nice to hear from you and read your messages .

I 'm doing my job and studying for my master 's degree .
My master 's first semester , I studied courses such as Thin Film Fabrications and Applications , Theoretical Physics , and Diffraction Methods . Theoretical Physics was a little bit boring .
Studying Raman spectroscopy .
I am glad that the weather will be warming , with the temperature rising from -4 to +2 degrees Celsius .
The problem is that there is not enough time to learn English .
It 's bad .
I 'm confused , but I know only one thing : I must study English .
It had been long discussed that people always learn big lessons from mistakes .
Some people think there is no room for mistakes in daily life , work , or even in their family .
However , I certainly consider mistakes to be a truly necessary step in our learning experience .
I am going to share a true story about Michael to support my viewpoint .
Michael was a six-year-old child who lived in the lovely countryside with his parents and his newborn little brother , Tom .
In this small countryside , Michael received all of his parents ' love , attention , and passion .
Nonetheless , things went differently until little Tom was born ; Michael lost all care suddenly .
He felt deep despair and tried his best to regain the respect that belonged to him .
In a zoo in the south of France , millions of species live .
This place is visited daily by many children and adults from both this country and other countries .
One day , some friends from the city where this zoo is decided to stroll along the river , have a picnic , play football , and spend a good time together .
They were on holiday .
Suddenly , while they were playing football and each eating a sandwich , Max saw a little lion that wanted to attack and take all of their food . Although it was endearing to see this situation , Bob was a little scared .
Max was very fond of the animal because he thought it was very small and very playful ; otherwise , he and his three other friends would never have approached the animal .
It was dusk , in the warm summer of southern France , when they saw two security men walking towards them from the large zoo in the city . We looked at each other and said that the animal had escaped from the zoo .
Finally , under the starry sky and full night , each one of us returned to our own house .
He was very exhausted and said , `` What an amazing day !
Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I 'm so glad to hear you are coming !
The original sentence `` You have no idea how happy I am . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
In connection with your question , I 'll try to tell you how you can reach my house .
There are three possibilities . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Firstly , you can take a taxi , but I have to warn you about the taxi drivers .
They 're sly boots , and they could ask you to pay more than it really costs .
The original sentence `` Secondly , you can take the bus . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Unfortunately , our buses are n't comfortable .
And the last alternative , which I recommend to you , is my car !
I 'll wait to collect you at the airport , and it wo n't cost you anything .
Since you asked about the best places to visit , I 'd suggest visiting a few places such as Oxford , London , and Piccadilly .
These places are really beautiful !
I 'm sorry I wo n't be able to accompany you on your excursions , as I do n't have much free time and need to complete my assignments .
You 're lucky because the museums and galleries are not too far from my house .
Your original sentence is already correct . However , if you want to make a slight adjustment for clarity , you could write : '' You can visit one of the most famous museums in the UK , such as the British Museum .
I recommend visiting the galleries in the Royal Academy of Arts and the National Portrait Gallery .
I 'm certain you will not be disappointed ! ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I had never felt so nervous before in my life because it was my first time being on stage and singing in front of such a big crowd .
How could I possibly have known that some months after that day I would be performing for the president of our country in front of even more people ?
As I walked towards the stage in this hall , feeling every eye piercing me , several things were running through my head .
I thought of losing my consciousness , getting a heart attack , or even worse : being called a bad singer by somebody from the audience .
At this point , my knees started wobbling , and I felt as if I were going on pudding .
Whenever I flash back to those seconds , which felt like hours , I have no idea how I managed to get on that stage , but somehow I finally found myself standing there , in slow motion , reaching for the microphone with my hands shaking as if an earthquake had just occurred .
The original sentence `` The moment had come . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I inhaled and could almost feel the air expanding my lungs .
I opened my mouth , tried to calm down , and bring all my concentration to the first note , which ... did n't come .
Well , it did , but it was n't noticeable to anybody .
So I tried again , and suddenly my attitude changed from that of a mouse who was nervous as hell to that of a woman who loved singing and sharing it with the world .
The melody started to flow , and I was happily filling the hall with music .
Like it is said at the top , `` There is no future for public transport , because traveling by car is so much more convenient .
Yes , I agree with that because now people are getting tired of waiting for the bus or any public transport vehicles . Now , the personal car is the power if you want to go ...
I do n't know ... In a place like your holiday house , maybe a bus can not arrive there , and you need a personal car .
If you want to move stuff from one place to a different place , you ca n't do that with a bus . You need a personal car , so a personal car is better than a public transport vehicle .
The principal aim of this report is to provide the organisers of an international festival with information about the interests of young people in my country .
I am going to write about their interests in music , television programs , and the clothes they are used to wearing , concluding with my personal statement .
Firstly , by conducting a survey among young people in my area , it emerged that music is essential for them .
In fact , youngsters are inspired by the songs they listen to , as well as by the music videos .
For the same token , most of those surveyed claimed that their favorite singer was also their idol .
Secondly , young people expressed their interest in television programs , such as films and series .
Series became so popular that numerous teenagers spent at least half of their afternoons watching them on their devices , neglecting schoolwork and extracurricular activities .
Moreover , sometimes young people get obsessed with TV series , and they lose their social life as well .
Lastly , but not least , youngsters are interested in fashion .
In fact , almost every girl interviewed admitted that she is very keen on being fashionable , and a large number of them claimed that they love having a wide range of clothes in order to show how fancy they are .
In conclusion , I personally think that the next international festival should consider all of these young people 's interests if the organizers want it to be a success .
In the picture , I can see a boy walking two dogs on the seaside .
I think he 's about twelve years old .
He is wearing a black-and-white jacket and black shorts .
The original sentence `` He is shoeless . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
One dog has got brown fur ; its breed is dachshund .
The second dog is white , and its breed is Maltese .
The boy is looking at the dogs while leashing them .
It seems he is happy .
There are some rocks in the sea , and on the beach , there is also a bough lying on the sand .
The weather does n't look very bad , but it 's cloudy , and I think it 's not so hot there .
Dear Jo ,
Firstly , I would like to thank you for visiting my country . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I am sure that my country is the best option .
The reason why I say this is that it has plenty of wonderful landscapes as well as career opportunities .
Next , I am proud to tell you about the beauty of my country . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
There are 54 minorities living sociably together in the `` S '' -shaped country .
Every minority inhabits a region that is different from the others .
My country has not only modern cities but also quaint villages that make you feel a lot of emotion .
I would have to say that the cuisine is the thing you should n't miss .
Then , despite being a developing country , there are many opportunities to grow your career .
Nowadays , Vietnam has been attracting foreign investments from many countries .
Besides that , the dominant industry is also improving prominently , especially in the export field .
We export mainly agricultural products , for instance , rice , seasonal fruit , and vegetables .
Travel services occupy a large portion of my country 's GDP , with many types of travel options .
Finally , I am looking forward to seeing you in my country soon .
The sentence `` Sincerely , '' is typically used as a closing in a letter or email , and it does n't require correction . However , if you are looking for a more formal or complete closing , you might consider adding your name or a title after `` Sincerely , '' like this : '' Sincerely , [ Your Name ] '' If you have a specific context or additional text that needs correction , please provide more details .
It seems like `` Ngoc Duong '' is a name and does n't require correction . If you intended to provide more context or if there 's a specific issue with the name that needs addressing , please let me know !
A topic that I like very much is electricity .
In today 's world , everybody uses electrical energy for almost everything .
It is present in your personal computer , lamps , and anything that you need to plug in .
But what almost no one knows is that the electricity travels a long way to arrive at your houses .
The journey starts in the power plant , where the electricity is generated by resources like water , wind , solar energy , nuclear energy , and other methods .
Then , the electrical energy travels to the substation .
After this , the electrical energy needs to lose a little bit of energy to arrive at your house without trouble , and this occurs in a place called a substation .
Therefore , we need to think very carefully before wasting energy .
Because it is an expensive cost for you and mainly for the environment , it should be reconsidered .
Could you please provide the sentence or text labeled `` ESSAY '' that you would like corrected ?
It is widely known that the majority of teenagers are keen on video games.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Some people believe that it 's a waste of time and a bad habit too , while others think that it 's a good way to spend your free time .
To my mind , there are pros and cons .
First of all , computer games can help you escape from your busy schedule and get some rest and relaxation after school .
Apart from that , it is quite convenient mainly because you stay at home and have entertainment .
Also , video games are more interesting than traditional toys , so they capture teenagers ' interest .
Last but not least , some of them are educational and provide you with the ideal opportunity to gain knowledge .
The original sentence `` On the other hand , there are many drawbacks . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
To begin , when you spend a lot of hours in front of the computer screen , you become addicted to it .
As a result , you do n't get together with your friends , and you do n't communicate face to face .
In addition , a lot of video games are full of violence , and teens tend to imitate them , leading to violent and aggressive behavior .
Also , playing video games for hours is very harmful to your eyes . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
In conclusion , computer games are a nice way to spend your free time , but always in moderation .
I feel the invention of the computer has significantly changed people 's lives . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
This , realistically , has been quite a new invention , and in its short lifespan , it has been able to change the world significantly .
Not to mention how it will change people 's lifestyles in the future .
These changes resulting from the invention of the computer have been , I feel , both bad and good .
Technologically , computers have drastically improved people 's lives .
No longer are the times when people must write a paper manually or even with a simple typewriter .
Personal computers are becoming quite common , and therefore , less expensive and easier to own .
Computers have also made life transpire much quicker than before .
Gone are the days when a person who wanted money from a bank had to wait until it was open . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
We now have ATMs , automatic teller machines , that are able to proceed with the same transactions as a teller would .
It seems these days everything is run by computers !
We are able to complete our tasks more effectively and efficiently .
Basically , every facet of life has been affected by computers , bringing about positive results .
While computers have brought about improvements , in my opinion , they have also `` impersonalized '' the world .
Jobs are being taken away from humans who are not `` fast enough .
Interaction with humans in some places is extinct .
Yes , it might be more efficient to have a computer make your transaction at a bank , but I miss the human interaction between people .
In addition , it is also very dangerous to place all of one 's trust in a machine . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct , so no changes are necessary . )
It is a common fact that machines do fail !
Sure , a car with a computer that tells the driver when an oncoming obstacle is approaching is safe , but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain ?
People soon stop thinking and allow machines to do the work for them .
I feel afraid when our society relies so heavily on a bunch of wires .
Computers are not able to express and truly feel emotions , and therefore are incapable , in some instances , of functioning .
With the invention of the computer come many changes , from the lifestyle of the past to changes in the lifestyle for the future .
Some of these changes , such as advances in medical technology and safety , will save people 's lives .
But I fear that our world will become a very impersonal place . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I hope that we will be able to determine what improvements should be made and what should just remain `` slow .
Dear Mrs. Ashby ,
I am writing to apply for one of the positions helping at your cafe .
I saw an advertisement for this job near my house .
I have the right qualifications for this job ; for instance , I have taken courses in cooking , and hence I am interested in all kinds of food .
Furthermore , I am very good at dealing with people . Last summer , I attended as a guide at a museum .
I am very hard-working , enjoy working with other people , and would agree to work as much as you need .
I would like the opportunity to work in a café .
The original sentence `` I am a sociable person and I like working with others . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
In addition , this job would offer me more experience in my chosen professional field , since I want to apply in the future as a chef in a restaurant .
I am available for an interview at any time .
I am looking forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience .
The original sentence `` Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I can be contacted at 0741123456 at any hour .
The original sentence `` Yours faithfully , '' is already correct and does not require any changes . It is a standard closing for a formal letter when the recipient 's name is not known .
It seems like `` Flor Barbus '' might be a name or a phrase that needs context for correction . If it 's a name , it might not need correction . Could you provide more context or clarify what you would like corrected ?
I would like to recommend Mzoli 's restaurant .
The original sentence `` It is a place located in the heart of Warsaw . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
A lot of foreigners go there to try delicious traditional South African grilled food .
It is rather an informal restaurant , designed in a rustic style , which guarantees a really nice ambiance .
When it comes to food , you can try all kinds of grilled meat , even the most exotic ones .
About the service , I can call it unusual as you choose your meat and the staff will prepare your dish ; then you go to the kitchen to get your dish and eat it with your hands .
I have been there once , and I really like that place . You feel at home , and the food is delicious .
The price is also the cheapest I could find in this country .
The main reason I like that place is that I can see many different people from different parts of the world .
I have been there several times , but I would still like to go there again with my classmates .
The best film .
I am a fan of a film club called High School Musical Fans .
High School Musical is the best film I could see in the world .
When you see the thriller , you ca n't stop looking for it , and immediately you want to see the film .
It 's a move that everyone could see .
I think I find it exciting because I love all films like them .
This great movie is about a group of people who go to a secondary school . This school is not like all schools ; it 's different because you can do a lot of activities like basketball , theater , etc .
I think that people might like to see it because when you watch , you can pause it , and there is a lot of music , songs , and people dancing .
In my opinion , it 's the best film I have seen in my life , and if you have the opportunity to see it , do it .
The reason why fox hunting should be banned is that it is a cruel sport .
There are many people trying to stop the sport from taking place .
The reason why people kill and hunt foxes is that they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport .
In this present time , I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox from getting at their chickens .
If they did this , then there would not be a need for killing foxes and going on hunts .
When hunts take place , other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxes .
Some homes of animals may be destroyed , and some innocent animals may be harmed .
Once the foxes are caught , it is said that they suffer a horrible death , and if this continues , it will be unfair .
Many people have no problems with foxes , and the hunt should not be included as a sport , as it will not be fun to experience .
If fewer foxes are killed , it means that there will be more rabbits around to destroy the crops , so this will be a disadvantage to a lot of farmers . However , this is not cruel ; it is just the way of life .
Fox hunting is a horrible sport , as the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback .
The fox is then chased until it is caught . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Thinking about this is very upsetting , and most people would be relieved if fox hunting were banned .
Foxes have as much right on this earth as we do , and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way .
I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt , so I do not see why we should put foxes through it .
If foxes are unable to harm farm animals , there is no danger in banning the sport .
The reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the number of foxes down and prevent a change in the food chain .
Foxes are not needed to keep down the rabbit population , as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits .
If you ban fox hunting , it means that the protesters will have won , and this gives them the incentive to protest about something else .
A few people enjoy the sport , and it allows them to socialize .
I believe that fox hunting should be banned as it is very cruel .
Another reason why it should not be banned is that foxes give chickens a cruel death when they kill them .
If they decide they have to continue the sport because they need to kill the foxes , the sport should be banned , and a more humane method of killing should be considered .
Could you please provide the sentence you would like corrected ?
This report will address whether cars should be banned from the centers of all major cities .
The number of cars has increased in countries in the last decade .
Too many cars running around people can be a serious problem to deal with .
But what should we do to make it up to them ?
There are some pros and cons . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Pros :
First , there would be less noise in the streets .
In particular , in Spain , where city centres are usually quite narrow .
Second , there would be less air pollution . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
It is proven that too much smog in the atmosphere is harmful to health .
Third , cities would be friendlier to live in .
People could enjoy walking around in these places .
The original sentence `` Cons '' is incomplete . To correct it , you would need to provide additional context or information . For example , if you are listing the disadvantages of something , you might write : Corrected sentence : Cons : High cost , limited availability , and potential side effects .
First , local sellers ' work could be disrupted in that area because they might need to upload and download goods for the shops .
Second , people who live in that part of the city could be affected in a negative way because they might need to pass through it with their cars to get home .
In my opinion , it would be a good idea to do it , but we would need to balance different interests in order to do it right .
There is an opinion that computers will replace books in the future .
I believe that it is true because computers are more convenient and easier to use .
Tablets are light , and you can use them without carrying many heavy books .
And it is common knowledge that gadgets make our lives easier .
But some people have a different opinion about it .
Firstly , studying at school became simple . Students can find a lot of different information about something interesting .
The original sentence `` I do n't know where to start . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I 'm only going to bare my heart to my computer . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct . `` Bare '' is the correct word here , meaning to reveal or expose . )
Corrected sentence : I feel lonely myself .
And I do n't know exactly what I need , and I do n't know definitely what I should do .
But I understand for sure that I need some changes in my life .
I wish some really pleasant and enjoyable events would burst into my life .
It must happen , I 'm sure .
The question is , how long do I have to have been waiting yet ?
My patience is already running out .
I refuse to understand and accept the fact that I ca n't afford a luxurious life .
Yes , I always dreamed about wealth .
I am not a greedy , avaricious person .
I only want my wishes to be fulfilled .
I do not have many desires in my mind .
I only wish my most favorite and loved ones to be healthy , wealthy , and happy .
I wish my daughters , my husband , and I were traveling a lot , we loved each other , and we had enough money for everything we wanted .
The Single European Act , signed in February 1986 by the Heads of Government of the 12 Member States of the European Community , and which came into force on 1st July 1987 , aims to create a single market by the end of the year 1992 .
This major target is to be attained by the removal of all fiscal , technical , and physical barriers .
This means that a merchant or tradesman would be able to sell his goods in any community country , an individual would be able to borrow and deposit money in the banks of any member state , and also work in any member state with national qualifications .
There would also be the introduction of a European passport and an integrated transport system . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Despite the fact that the proposals put forward to amend the Treaty of Rome came from an Englishman , namely Lord Cofield , there has been widespread dissatisfaction in Britain regarding the single market , as shown by frequent discussions in Parliament and letters to leading national newspapers . Meanwhile , Jacques Delors , the president of the European Commission , described the measures adopted as a mere compromise .
In accordance with the constitutional law of Britain , Parliament is the supreme law-making body in the United Kingdom .
Consequently , the emergence of another source of law , deemed to be supra-national , is inevitably a problem .
One of the prerogative powers conferred upon Parliament is the right to make treaties.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
However , these treaties are not directly effective on British individuals , so where a treaty contains provisions giving rights and duties to an individual , he can not place reliance upon the treaty until it is substantially incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom by an Act of Parliament .
This acts as a curb to the enforcement of European Community Law , so that , to a certain extent , a degree of sovereignty is retained .
Yet , this is not as advantageous as it may at first appear , for there exists a general judicial presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate contrary to European Community law .
Personally , I think that although the integration of Britain into Europe will be beneficial in many areas , such as freedom of transportation , movement , work , and other realms , there are also many disadvantages , including the loss of sovereignty to a certain extent .
Although the British Parliament will continue to regulate the acts or omissions of individuals on a personal basis , for example , in Criminal Law , its freedom to legislate in the domain of public law will be severely restricted .
Not only will Parliament be obliged to enforce Community Law , but also any later statutes passed by the British Parliament will either be construed in the light of Community provisions or declared invalid.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
To conclude , it is feasible to imply that the sovereignty of Britain will be impaired in many ways , although only within the sphere of Community Law prevailing over national law . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
In other senses , the sovereignty of Britain will be safeguarded , for Parliament will still reign supreme within the United Kingdom .
The turn of the century has brought with it many changes that have greatly altered lives throughout the globe . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Each decade , in itself , has introduced a new `` fad '' or discovery that has been fixed in our minds as `` typical '' of the era .
The `` Roaring 20s , '' for example , was marked by flapper skirts and the invention of the automobile .
A very capricious decade , the 1920s can be contrasted with the years of hunger and unemployment that marked the `` Great Depression '' of the '30s .
How could we ever forget the `` Fabulous Fifties '' or the hippie decades of the '60s and '70s ?
For change is inevitable , and as difficult as it may be to pinpoint any one accomplishment that has taken place over the last 100 years as the most remarkable of the century , there is one aspect of the 20th century that will remain with me forever .
So , as we embark on the year 2000 , I think it is only fair to call the 20th Century `` The Century of Democracy .
Perhaps it is because today is November 4th , the day after the U.S. elections .
Perhaps it is because the former superpower of the Soviet Union is now making its transition into a democracy .
Perhaps it is because I am thousands of miles from my home , but I 'm feeling very patriotic these days .
No , I 'm not engulfed in the typical ethnocentric idealism of a citizen of the United States .
Rather , I 'm feeling patriotic because I can look around the world today and see that it is becoming a better place to live for people of all nations . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
In the past 2 years alone , we have seen people all over the world finally take a stand for what they believe in .
Not too long ago , I remember the democratic demonstrations that led the people of East and West Germany to unite as one democratic nation .
At the World Expo in Sevilla , not a month ago , I bought a chunk of what was once the Berlin Wall—the Wall that was a symbol to many of the harsh realities of the Cold War .
That wall is gone forever , and I feel lucky to be among the many who could witness its fall .
The Soviet Union , as well , is going through its own transition to democracy .
The many unhappy people of this troubled nation finally took it upon themselves to rid their nation of its communist government . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The superpower among superpowers that , to me , had long been the example of Marxism is now following in the footsteps of the rest of the world .
With the end of the Cold War , there have been more peaceful relations throughout the world .
The idea of a nuclear war is practically nonexistent today .
Arms sales have gone down so that nations may spend this money on more worthwhile areas .
In conclusion , as the turn of the century slowly approaches , I look back with a feeling of accomplishment , as well as anticipation for what lies ahead .
As a world of many scattered nations , conflict is inevitable .
However , if we all have one bond—democracy—then maybe together we can learn to understand one another and work towards a happier world for all .
It is a well-known fact that everybody needs holidays .
To begin with this topic , we need to ask ourselves about several matters to keep in mind .
Firstly , we must be aware of our economic situation , the season we are in , the people who come with us , the transport , the accommodation , the place , and other matters that we should consider when we decide to go on holiday .
Secondly , we should consider two main options : going abroad or staying around our home .
This could be the first question that we wonder about before going on holiday .
Nowadays , due to globalization and the increased number of flights around the world , we can find a wide range of webpages where airlines offer their services at incredibly low prices .
Because of these low prices , many people decide to go abroad instead of traveling near their home .
Of course , in order to prepare a good trip , you must also consider the accommodation , the food , etc. , and depending on the place you choose , you will spend more or less money .
Another point to consider should be the environment . If you go abroad , you can visit the most well-known typical monuments and historical natural places around the world . If you stay in your country , although you can see many places , the things to see are limited .
In conclusion , I think one must consider several points when planning a holiday trip . It depends on the person 's knowledge about where to go and how to determine if a trip could be cheaper or more expensive .
Dear Sir ,
My name is Tomas García , and I am writing regarding the advertisement that appeared in the newspaper yesterday about the summer camp job .
I am 25 years old and come from Spain .
My mother tongue is Spanish , but I can speak English fluently too .
Besides , as you can see from my enclosed CV , I studied for a Law Degree and worked in companies such as ... and ... , in jobs very similar to the one you are offering .
That is why I consider that my experience and qualifications fit very well with this position 's requirements .
Moreover , I would especially like to point out that I have always been interested in working with people , particularly in taking care of little children and helping them to be happy .
For all these reasons , I consider myself a very suitable candidate for this position , and I would appreciate the opportunity to come in for an interview and discuss this vacancy with you further .
My contact information is in the attached CV , for your convenience .
The original sentence `` I look forward to hearing from you . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Yours sincerely ,
The European Community is a group of 12 sovereign European states whose intention is to develop closer economic and political cooperation .
Its intention is to encourage greater freedom of movement of goods and also services , capital , and the workforce .
The competition for trade is so great in modern times that Britain has no choice but to join Europe in order to increase the market for its goods .
Britain has been recognized as having a particular skill in the areas of banking and insurance .
The European market will give us the opportunity to use this skill in a far wider market .
The creation of one European commercial market will also benefit the consumer , since a homogenization of standards is also in the process of being introduced , hopefully to the highest common denominator .
The European Union does not serve only as a useful trade association , however , for environmental problems can be tackled more effectively if the European community confronts such problems together .
Cooperation between the communities ' police forces will assist in overcoming the problems of drug smuggling and terrorism .
The common defense policy of such a large area of Europe would also be beneficial and possibly less costly if the member states pooled their resources .
However , some loss of national sovereignty will inevitably occur .
The Single European Act was designed to speed up the decision-making of certain institutions .
The act meant that member governments had to be committed to greater cooperation and joint action in the areas of foreign , social , and environmental policy , thus leaving less room for differences of opinion among the members .
The decisions of the European Court of Justice already take precedence over national law , which can be seen as a major infringement of our national sovereignty.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
More participation in the election of members of the European Parliament would help elect those best suited to promote British interests in Europe .
The question is how much sovereignty Britain is prepared to lose , and whether the benefits of belonging to a single Europe outweigh the disadvantages .
A certain loss of sovereignty has already been felt , and in the next few years , this will increase .
As far as the immediate future is concerned , a certain loss of sovereignty is the price we have to pay for material progress .
In most of the earlier studies , the effect of either ocean acidification or warming has been investigated one at a time .
However , in nature , these stressors affect the organism in combination , and the effect could be greater than the effect of a single stressor .
I remember how the old people interacted with their children .
They were all poor ; they did n't have enough money to pay for their children 's education .
All the children should help their parents .
Some of them have been adopted by other parents .
The children wanted to get an education , but they did n't have enough money to pay .
Some of the children were working in the sugar cane field or they worked in a shop to earn money to feed themselves , and there were many good people who behaved well .
Nowadays , many people have changed their lifestyle .
And their lives have become like birds in the sky .
Some of them have already achieved their life goals .
They have plenty of money , and their children have all that they want , but some children have very bad manners .
They do n't respect their parents , and they do not wonder what they did .
Some of them have already given birth to a child at the age of sixteen or gotten married .
The world has already changed now .
They have good doctors who are qualified and have great skill .
Many people contributed to the development of their own country .
For example , they want to attract more and more tourists to their country .
Some of the children who are eighteen years old have already left their homes to live with their girlfriends .
They did not remember what their parents had done for them .
The people have changed the style of their life .
Some of the boys like to get a new hairstyle .
Just like girls , they like to carry many accessories with them , such as makeup .
They want to create a new fashion to make a name for themselves .
People became more skilled and also more bad-mannered .
The next 50 years , people will be able to create many electronic things like cars and machines such as televisions .
The television has brought many advantages that would never have been envisaged by our great-grandparents .
People will develop more advanced television models .
Year by year , the world will change and become more developed .
Long ago , the early cars had wooden bodies , which made them extremely vulnerable in the event of a crash .
About 30 years ago , cars switched to all-steel bodies .
Today , cars are stronger , lighter , and safer than earlier designs .
It means that today , people are creating more new features .
The television is an interesting source of information that people see every day . It offers a range of programs , from comedy shows to quantum physics . The television can be a subject of study if you propose it as such ; it is just another tool in your investigation .
If you arrive in the morning , you can watch the TV news , which has good ratings , as everyone needs to have information about the world day after day .
If you enter in the afternoon , you will find kids or young people , but those who really have an interest in this proposal are the people who want to watch soap operas at this time and also want to see comedies or interesting documentaries about whatever we want .
Hi Ana ,
Yes , I am in the process of learning English right now .
By coincidence , I work in the IT sphere now ; therefore , I need this language in my daily communication with customers .
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions .
Thanks .
It seems like the sentence `` Alex '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or additional information so I can help you correct or complete it ?
I do n't agree .
I think the future is in public transport .
Also , I think this applies to many things .
Now we live in a shared world , where everything is shared : work , development , ideas , and many other things .
The original sentence `` This is a new philosophy . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The base of this philosophy is `` sharing .
This idea brings great benefits for all .
Is it the same case for the transport ?
If we shared transport ( public transport ) , there would be fewer cars , therefore resulting in less contamination and less traffic .
Everybody saves money , and the family economy is better .
The cities become more agile , and it is easier to get to places .
This model has many advantages .
To solve the problem of the traditional model , because when the traffic is worst , the time in both kinds of transport can increase and become unbearable . It 's more comfortable and quicker to move using personal transport , but if only one mode of transport exists , it will be more efficient and comfortable for all of us .
I think the whole world would benefit : environment , people , family , work , and so on .
I agree with this statement . I think the future will be such that everyone will have their own car and they wo n't use public transport .
Nowadays , every person wants to live conveniently for themselves .
So they just buy a new car for their own use .
The original sentence `` But some people ca n't buy it . '' is already grammatically correct . However , if you are looking for a more formal or complete version , you could consider : '' However , some people are unable to purchase it . `` This version maintains the original meaning while using a slightly more formal tone .
Because they do n't have enough money and they have material problems .
So they account for using public transport .
There is something untouchable to poor people .
In my opinion , using public transport will not be as popular as traveling by car .
In my opinion , public transport has a long future because many people live in big cities and do n't use cars to move around the city . Public transport is more convenient , as they can take the bus , then the underground , and finally arrive at any place they want .
Corrected sentence : But if they use the car , they will probably be late for the place they are going .
I think if people use public transport , there will be less pollution , and the sky in the city would be blue instead of grey , so nobody should say that public transport does n't have a future .
Moreover , a lot of people use public transport because they do n't have a car .
In conclusion , nowadays people are very conscious about the environment , which could be affected by cars , and they do n't use cars a lot , so I think that is n't the end for public transport .
Today we watch a lot of television . I think that it is not a great habit , because watching more television can make you become lazy .
In addition , most of these programs are stupid , good only for wasting your time .
The reason is that a lot of people do n't want to receive bad news ; they only love to be entertained .
Fortunately , not all TV channels have these programs .
There is somebody who tries to invent new programs to educate people .
One of these is Channel 5 . During the day , they transmit some interesting programs about history and nature .
I strongly believe that it 's possible to do both programs .
For example , during the day , it 's possible to mix sending news , quiz programs , documentaries , and interviews .
If we had channel programs like these , I am sure that all Italian citizens could gain a good benefit and more knowledge about our beautiful world .
Dear Alison ,
How are you doing ? I am writing to let you know about the eating habits and customs in my country .
In Argentina , the most typical foods are empanadas , mate , and dulce de leche .
I am one hundred percent sure that everyone in this country has already tried empanadas at least once .
The original sentence `` We usually have breakfast as soon as we wake up . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Most people usually drink chocolate milk and eat biscuits for breakfast .
We also have a tea time , and we eat similar to what we have in the morning . I know it will sound kind of weird to you ! We have lunch at twelve o'clock and dinner around ten .
What really makes a traditional Sunday in Argentina is the food , most commonly the barbecue , with the whole family .
It is a custom that I hope I will never lose ! You should come to visit me and experience it for yourself ; I am sure you will love it !
I hope my letter has helped you ! ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Best wishes .
It seems like the sentence `` Belu '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or the full sentence so I can help with the correction ?
Lots of people believe that sooner or later public transport will lose its important role .
First of all , due to the fact that traveling by car is much more convenient .
Actually , you can use your vehicle not only to get to the office or to reach the shopping mall , but also to go on holiday without having to stand in a queue before catching a train , a plane , or a bus .
Actually , there are lots of traffic jams , and it is quite common to be stuck along the road .
But it could be quite the same for traveling by bus and other means of transport .
Secondly , cars are becoming cheaper day by day , so everyone can afford to buy one , even those who are not considered wealthy .
So far , public transport has been considered relatively cheap , environmentally friendly , and fast .
On the one hand , we can not forget that cars have a negative impact on air quality and that they are one of the most significant causes of pollution .
On the other hand , everyone is more or less aware that airline companies surely have a great impact on air pollution .
Anyway , it could be possible to travel by car , and when you arrive at a certain destination , you can choose to cycle or walk instead of catching buses , trains , the underground , or other public means of transport .
Cycling or walking could be even better than public transport : much healthier , cheaper , and faster .
We must also take into consideration the fact that the car industry has developed lots of new vehicles .
There are now new models available , for example , electric cars , that are environmentally friendly ; they are not so expensive , so everyone can buy one .
In conclusion , I strongly believe that there is no future for public transport and that traveling by car will become faster , cheaper , and even less environmentally dangerous day by day .
I think doing sports is healthy .
When we do sport , we feel better , and our body and mind are in good condition .
My favorite activity is yoga .
I go to the gym three times a week.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
I love it because when the class finishes , I feel well .
I sometimes take a walk in the forest .
I walked the Santiago Way 10 years ago .
I like it very much .
I walked 760 km . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I started in Roncesvalles , and I finished in Santiago de Compostela .
This path is so beautiful .
I met a lot of people from other countries , such as Brazil , Germany , and Australia , and so on .
A car might be more comfortable , but it is still riskier than a train or bus .
I prefer to use my private car because of the long distance between my home and my company 's location .
Michael was just sitting there , wondering what would come next in his life .
Time passed , and while the answers still did not come to him , that was the moment he decided to make things happen .
He took a bag filled with clothes and snacks . No matter what , this would become the adventure of his life , a new beginning .
He walked outside his home and took the very first cab he saw .
Nowhere was written in black bold letters on a sign in the front window of that cab .
He started wondering about the infinite choices he had ahead .
Just take me to a bar , he thought to himself , but no , that was too simple .
Take me to the airport , he repeated in his mind , but no , that is too crazy .
Just drive , it does n't matter where , '' he said to the taxi driver , whispering to his feet , `` maybe I should not run away .
He felt the guilt of leaving the very second he grabbed the cab door .
Was it because of his wife ?
No .
Was it because of her daughter ?
The sentence `` No . '' is already correct as it stands . It is a complete sentence that conveys a clear meaning . No correction is necessary .
It was because of his poorly paid job ?
The sentence `` No . '' is already correct as it stands . It is a complete sentence that can be used to express a negative response or denial . No correction is necessary .
It was because he did not have the courage before ; before , it was selfish ; before , it was incorrect .
But the question rounding his mind was : `` Does that really matter ?
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
It is true that traveling by car is much more convenient than traveling by public transport . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct in terms of grammar and punctuation . The only change made here is the spelling of `` travelling '' to `` traveling , '' which is the American English spelling . If you prefer British English , `` travelling '' is also correct . )
But at the same time , it also consumes much more energy than traveling by public transport .
Corrected sentence : Rather than saying there is no future for public transport , we should explore ways to improve and invest in it .
I think it is more accurate to say that there 's no future for individual auto transport .
Due to global warming , many countries , including Taiwan , Turkey , and Germany , have started to promote public transport in order to protect our environment .
Their government tries to increase oil prices and decrease public transport prices .
Although the government tries to make us use more public transport , it has not been entirely successful .
I think there 's still a limited impact on our society .
The most efficient way is to promote it ourselves .
If we all start to use public transport and tell people how good it is for our planet , we can make a positive impact .
I guess more people will start doing it .
Social Networks .
If you want to talk with your friends , share photos , or post anything you want , you have many opportunities to do that on social sites .
Nowadays , people use the Internet to do anything—from obtaining information to sharing photos , uploading videos , and other useful activities .
So , social networks are now very widespread on the internet .
The most popular social networks are Facebook , Twitter , Yahoo , Flickr , WhatsApp , Tumblr , Ask.fm , etc .
Let 's take Facebook as an example .
Facebook is the biggest and most used social network .
The original sentence `` It has more than 1 billion users . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
You can use a Facebook account for texting your friends , keeping in touch with them , sharing your own experiences , receiving notifications , uploading photos and videos , and , of course , seeing what your friends post .
You can also see what their opinion is and what 's new in politics , business , and entertainment .
You can promote your own business , so your products and services can more easily find their target .
Facebook has a lot of benefits , but at the same time it can be very dangerous !
There are so many people on the internet who pretend to be someone else .
Now , let me tell you my `` Facebook story .
When I was 11 years old , I created my first Facebook account .
The original sentence `` I was so excited about it ! '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I felt like I had just discovered the technology .
I started to post photos of myself , share videos , update my status , and meet new people .
Then , I thought it was `` cooler '' to write on Facebook that I lived in the Netherlands and worked at Jack Daniel 's .
I remember that I used to answer everybody , no matter who they were .
I talked with Romanian , Indian , Arab people , and other foreigners .
I did n't realize I was in danger .
Two years later , when I was 13 years old , I started to realize that my old photos , videos , and statuses were completely stupid , and I decided to delete them all !
I have also changed my workplace and my country , and I deleted the unknown people from my `` friends list , '' but I made a really big mistake : I made my phone number public !
One week later , after making my phone number public , I was called by a lot of strangers , and some of them were using a private number .
I really did n't like it ! ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Now , I 'm 15 years old , and I think I 'm mature enough to use Facebook . I have learned a lot from the big mistakes I made on Facebook up until now .
I do n't accept friend requests from people I do n't know , I do n't talk to strangers , I do n't give out my personal details ( especially my phone number ) , and I think twice before posting something .
I 'm thinking now : What was going through my mind when I was talking with strangers ?
Oh my God , I was in really big danger !
So , I want to give you some advice : Do n't let your kids access Facebook if they are under 13 years old because they can be very naive , and psychos , rapists , etc. , are everywhere on the Internet .
In my opinion , social networks can be useful if you know how to use them , as long as you do n't let them control you .
The sentence `` I have a dream . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
It seems big , or not ; I do n't know .
But I really want to make it come true .
My dream originates from Messi . I do n't know how , but Messi is my inspiration .
He gave me a dream to go abroad .
Then I will meet him . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Yes .
He is also my motive .
Young people and their interest in health and fitness
Nowadays , there 's a great deal of information available both on the Internet and on TV about why we need to be fit and why it 's so important to stay healthy .
However , are young people aware of these facts ? ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I consider that most of them do n't pay enough attention to their health and fitness since they spend a lot of time drinking alcohol and smoking .
In spite of going to the gym , they behave badly at the weekend when they go clubbing , for example .
On the other hand , I consider that there is a large number of young people who have fun without drugs and alcohol .
They also go to the gym , play sports , and follow a healthy diet .
In my opinion , you need to be fit to stay healthy .
You should be on a diet and exercise .
If you do that , your body will act better than you expect .
Our lifestyle regrettably involves going to the gym to get fit but also going out to drink alcohol .
Both are impossible . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Hey , it 's me , Satyajit .
The sentence `` I am a student . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I am going to take the JEE MAIN entrance exam in Bhubaneswar , Odisha , India .
The original sentence `` I am a fan of SRK . '' is already correct and does not require any changes . `` SRK '' is a common abbreviation for Shah Rukh Khan , a famous Indian actor , and the sentence is grammatically correct as it stands .
I love you , Simpy ...
Would you like to come ?
Wawel - Management Center of the Old Capital City
Wawel was once one of the most important places in Central Europe for much of the Middle Ages .
There lived and led the bravest Polish king and leaders at a time when Poland was one of the strongest countries in the world and the strongest in Central Europe .
Recent Wawel is the number one place in Kraków for visitors because , apart from its rich history , we can find beautiful monuments , works of art , and , of course , we can get a lot of interesting information on a guided tour .
Apart from tourism , history at Wawel is being created up to the present . There , we can visit the cemetery where some of the most famous leaders of Poland , like Jan III Sobieski , Józef Piłsudski , and Lech Kaczyński , who was a recent President of Poland , are located .
In conclusion , Wawel is a place worth visiting if you are planning to visit southern Poland . The revitalization of Kraków city is also beautiful , so everything comes together nicely .
People who are planning to see Wawel should n't forget about other interesting places around Wawel , like Sukiennice , Smok Wawelski , and many wonderful temples—everything is no further than several hundred meters from Wawel .
Dear Jen ,
Last week , I went on an educational trip with some students from the same class , along with my class adviser .
The original sentence `` We visited the National Museum . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
It was nice to see the old relics that were preserved for a long time , preserving those relics that are being used today for us to learn what happened in the past .
After the trip , we took our lunch in a nearby food chain .
The original sentence `` We enjoyed discussing the trip . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
It was the day before yesterday , but Michael did not know that yet .
He just knew that he had to get to work on the novel he so desperately wanted to finish but had not managed to complete a single chapter of so far .
He placed himself in front of the oak desk , opened his silver laptop , and stared at the blank white page of the document in front of him .
He did not know what to write , even though he knew the story , the characters , the plot , and the twists at the end .
He knew the complexity , essence , feel , and every last detail of what he wanted to write . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Suddenly , he felt his mind running in circles , spiraling into the unknown , his fingers blazing over the keyboard faster than ever before , and the words assembled , gathered , became sentences , structured organizations of semantic meaning , and suddenly , the chapter was finished .
He had no doubt that the inspiration came from above .
He closed the writing program , and when asked whether or not to save the changes , he pressed `` Do n't Save , '' as he always did after not writing anything , and then put on his jacket to go for a walk to celebrate .
He went out the door and turned on his heel , looking in at his computer with a strange sensation in his stomach .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Hello , my name is Rolle .
I was born in Danderyds Sjukhus in 2000 .
I have a brother named Trogen .
He is 13 years old . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
My favorite sport is ice hockey .
I am playing hockey in the SDE league .
I started playing ice hockey when I was 6 years old .
I think my favorite place is Tigerbalsamhallen , where I play hockey , because I love to play hockey .
Three words that describe me are happy , hockey , and friends .
I do not have a favorite movie .
I like many movies , and the same goes for songs .
I like house music , and one of my favorite artists is Avicii .
I do n't want to miss Partaj because it is so funny .
Kebabs are my favorite food .
My favorite restaurant is Nico 's Pizzeria because they have the best kebab .
One of my favorite memories is when I was in New York and watched the New York Rangers in Madison Square Garden .
Dear Sir ,
I am writing regarding your request about recommending some places to visit for your students .
To be honest , four hours is not much when it comes to sightseeing in my city , and I have been thinking about it a lot , but in the end , I think I may have come up with a perfect idea .
I do not know if you have heard about our old castle .
It 's in the very center of the town , so it is very close to the hostel you are staying at .
We can visit it ; it is open from eight till twelve ( I checked ) , and they have wonderful exhibitions there—paintings , sculptures , historical artifacts , and some more modern pieces as well .
The best part is that at 1 p.m. , there is going to be a concert .
My friends from a school of music will be playing old instruments as an accompaniment to the slideshow of old photographs from the 19th century .
I think the best would be if we went together at ten in the morning , saw some paintings for two hours , then went for ice cream or pizza , or whatever the kids would like to have during the break , and then got back to the castle for the show .
Later , we can do whatever you would like to do .
If you have any questions , just write to me or call me on my cellphone at 123-456 .

When I started to think about my favorite sport , it was quite difficult for me to decide since I 'm very keen on practicing sports .
As long as I can remember back in time , I 've always been engaged in sports .
Nevertheless , if I had to choose one among all of them , running could be considered my favorite one .
Running is one of the cheapest and easiest sports to be practiced anywhere and at any time .
The only thing you need to do is just feel like spending half an hour breathing fresh air and relaxing .
An issue that is becoming increasingly debated is whether or not fox hunting should be banned .
In today 's society , it is an outdated and barbaric `` sport '' which , in my opinion , should be banned .
In this country , animal rights have been debated in parliament , and many measures have been implemented to safeguard animals ' welfare .
Recently , the British government has brought in legislation regarding how animals that are going to be slaughtered should be transported .
These measures include the time the animals spend on the road , how much room they have , etc .
etc .
However , it is still perfectly legal for a group of people to chase a fox with a pack of dogs and watch them chase the fox until it is exhausted and then gets torn apart by the dogs .
This , apparently , is a sport .
The Government has made it illegal for dogs to attack badgers , while it is still legal for dogs to attack foxes .
Surely , this is unfair and hypocritical of the government .
The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . Here it is again for reference : '' It is also illegal for two dogs to attack each other for the enjoyment of the spectators .
At least if one dog fights another , the fight is , in some ways , fair .
But it is still perfectly legal for an unlimited number of dogs to attack a single fox for the enjoyment of others .
The fox stands no chance . Why is fox hunting legal whereas all other blood sports are banned ?
Fox hunting is , for the most part , enjoyed by the upper class .
It is expensive to partake in , as you need a horse , dogs , and riding equipment ( e.g. , ) .
Helmet , boots , etc .
You also need land to do it on .
It is my opinion that the conservative government will not ban fox-hunting because it will lose the support and funding from its upper-class , wealthy supporters who fox hunt .
In a time when Britain has very few surviving wild animals , surely something should be done to protect the fox .
The British government is always among the first to support the protection of wild animals in other countries ( e.g. , when banning whaling ) , and they are very ready to criticize countries that do kill wild animals ( e.g. , the destruction of habitats in the Brazilian rainforests ) .
But when it comes to ceasing the hunting and brutal killing of one of Britain 's few natural animals , they seem to turn a blind eye .
According to people who partake in fox hunting , it is an enjoyable sport .
A sport is an activity where two evenly matched teams or individuals partake in a game for enjoyment or a prize .
It would be grossly unfair to match one footballer against a team of eleven , as the result would be a foregone conclusion .
If one boxer had to fight ten boxers , this would be unfair .
But matching one fox against a pack of dogs in a fight to the death is still considered a sport . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
Cricket is a sport ; the brutal chase and killing of a fox for the enjoyment of the upper class is not .
Famous people , such as politicians , film stars , and other celebrities , are ordinary people , just like us .
People always idolize them and think that they are unusual , but they simply have extraordinary careers .
First of all , everybody deserves to have their private life without journalists , even though they live in the limelight .
They should be able to spend their time with children , families , friends , etc. , to go on holidays , and to celebrate something .
On the other hand , I think that it 's impossible for these kinds of people to have private lives because fans and society want to know everything about them and their private lives .
They want to be in touch with their idols , to contact them , and to meet them in reality .
To sum up , if we are famous people , we should bear in mind that fans will admire us , and journalists will come to us , take photos of us , and print them in gossip magazines or tabloids ( all to meet the needs of the fans ) .
Stars should realize that they are the center of attention .
In addition , they should choose what is more important to them : career or private life .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to you to apply for the summer camp job .
I 'm a 20-year-old student who loves taking care of children .
For me , this would be an incredible experience to improve my skills in helping with the organization and cooking food .
I am a girl full of energy and always keep a smile on my face .
I think I am a great candidate for your job . If you need any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I look forward to hearing from you soon . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The original sentence `` Best wishes , Andrea . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
When the time arrived for Lucy to make the transition from being a teenager to an adult , all her self-assurance and determination vanished into thin air .
She had been a brilliant student in high school and intended to continue being one .
She expected to work and study all at the same time .
She had big plans , but sometimes you have to slow down to achieve them .
She was going to study journalism and do a part-time job in the meantime .
And she went for it : she started her career working as a cashier in a market , but by the end of the month , reality hit her in the face .
She started to feel exhausted , and her performance at university was deficient .
She needed to stop working or studying because her health was at risk ; she fell asleep in class and at work , her diet was poor , and her temper was terrible .
She could only understand how disastrous her life was when she reached the limit .
Even though nobody pushed her to , she took on too many responsibilities that she was n't able to accomplish .
Why are you running when you 're just learning to walk ? '' ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
One of her friends once told her .
I want to make my future , and I do n't want to waste time , '' she retorted , but was she happy ?
Since then , she has started to ask herself a lot of questions , and doubts have been her faithful companions .
During the week of exams , she suffered from her first panic attack .
That was the sign that it was definitely time for a change .
A friend of hers took her to a therapist , and after a few sessions , she began to catch a glimpse of what it was all about .
Success is not final , failure is not fatal : it is the courage to continue that counts .
Her therapist said .
There was finally a clue .
The original sentence `` She would have to work on that all her life , though . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Her biggest challenge was learning to accept her limits , but she would soon understand that life is about growing every day , so she 'd have to enjoy the journey and give her best over and over again .

How important is it for you to read books in English ?
In my opinion , it is important because it improves my vocabulary and helps me to express ideas easily .
Could you tell me if you have reading habits to learn English ?
I do n't have the reading habits to learn English . In my opinion , it is a custom that I should have learned when I was a child because I would have grown with reading as a hobby rather than as a duty .
Do you think it is difficult for you to create the habit of reading to learn English ?
I think it is difficult for me to create reading habits because I do n't like it , but I think it is possible if I practice it .
Most infant educators , psychologists , and professionals in the field of education think that using storytelling in early childhood education is beneficial for children 's development .
But ... is it that good ?
Corrected sentence : Does storytelling have any disadvantages ?
Using storytelling is a good way to work on values and emotions , as they are too young to express them by themselves .
They see themselves in the main character , and through his experiences , they can learn how to act in these situations .
For instance , if the story is about fear ( an emotion which makes them feel insecure ) and ends in a positive way , they will have different methods to overcome their fear and feel more secure and self-confident .
Furthermore , they can take part in and build up their own stories .
Their vocabulary will increase at the same time as they are working on their social skills .
In addition , they can see that every act has consequences , and they have to be responsible .
However , there are some points that need to be considered . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Storytelling must be chosen according to the age of the pupils . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
One of the reasons storytelling may not work is that some teachers expect more than their pupils can do .
Moreover , if the story is too long or dull , they will lose concentration easily and make their classmates lose it too .
To sum up , we must take advantage of storytelling to consolidate concepts , values , and emotions , and let imagination go .
I live in one of the biggest cities in the country .
People who live in our city generally face transportation problems .
Instead of long-term solutions , local authorities are focused on short-term solutions .
The quality of public transportation vehicles can be improved .
New forms of public transportation must be supported by the government .
People should be encouraged to use public transportation .
The human brain is the most powerful computer known to man , yet it is small and light .
It is the control center of a body ; it can instruct it to move freely around its surroundings and is able to interact with other humans and objects .
The brain can make decisions , and it can communicate .
The only function of the brain that computers can rival is memory .
Some of the functions of the human brain have been taken over by computers , such as accountancy , with the invention of electronic calculators .
In fact , the whole subject of mathematics has become quicker with the invention of the electronic calculator .
But the subject has not changed ; electronics have only solved a few mathematical puzzles .
Most of the theories used today were hypothesized and proven before the invention of the calculator .
Computers , however , have almost unimaginable accuracy .
Most high-precision engineering projects undertaken today use computers and laser technology to make parts accurate to thousandths of a millimeter .
The computer is very widely used in the modern-day world , but in almost every case , it is only an aid to the brain .
The human still has to tell the computer what to do . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The human is still in charge .
The human brain is in no way made redundant by the invention of the computer , and I think that it will be a long time before the technology is discovered to make an electronic machine that will compete with the brain to achieve even one of its functions , never mind all of which the human brain is capable .
Hello , Tara .
You are starting an amazing project in your life .
I know it is really difficult to start , but then it becomes easier .
You can start by asking your teacher and your schoolmates if they want to be part of that .
The original sentence `` They will probably say yes . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Together , you can decide what to do .
At my school , I did that , and it worked .
We started by creating rules to respect the environment ... I do n't want to share more ideas because it is important to be original .
Good luck !
It seems like the sentence `` João '' is incomplete . Could you please provide more context or the full sentence so I can help you with the correction ?
If the rate of car ownership continues to increase at such a rapid rate , then the roads will be completely congested .
This sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence `` The reasons for this are many and varied . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
People today want more freedom and have more disposable income , both factors that will lead to an increase in car ownership .
Many people also feel unsafe walking or using public transport to get to places , and mothers who would have walked to school when they were young insist on driving their children to school , as they believe , correctly or not , that there are too many child abductors around for it to be safe for children on the streets .
These views are supported by cases like the James Bulger case and the Fred and Mary West case , which have very high publicity and increase public awareness among people on the streets today .
People also use cars because they are more convenient than public transport , as they can travel whenever they wish and can travel `` door-to-door '' instead of having to walk to bus stops and stations .
The enormous levels of vehicles on the roads have meant that using a bicycle to travel has become unacceptable to many people due to the danger and the levels of pollution from cars on the streets .
Rail travel has seen decreased popularity in recent years due to the immense popularity of cars now .
Some people may not use trains due to their seemingly unreliable service .
Trains also fail to offer the freedom of choice available with cars , as the passengers are tied to the timetables and locations of railway stations .
I think that the government should help Britain 's transport by aiming to decrease the amount of car usage and increase the usage of buses , trains , and other forms of public transport .
The government should do this by investing more money in public transport than in road improvements , such as the widening of motorways .
This increased investment would lead to more attractive public transport , with more services on the timetables , lower rates , and fewer delays .
These factors may make people switch from using their cars to travel to work or school to using buses or trains instead .
This would lead to less congested roads , which could then be used efficiently by people with no other option , and a less polluted environment for all of us to live in .
This is because public transport is less polluting than personal car usage .
Scientists believe that it may not be safe to eat beef products . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Several years ago , the disease BSE , or 'Mad Cow Disease , ' became quite commonplace among cattle .
The disease incurs a mental deficiency , causing the cow to be unable to think for itself , and it slowly dies .
This BSE has been known to cross the animal barriers ; several sheep have had a similar disease after eating feed made from the remnants of dead , meat-stripped cows .
Now , scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and humans , as there are more and more cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ( CJD ) appearing .
There is , as of yet , no cure for this disease , and the only way humans can contract it is by eating beef products .
This has clearly put a lot of people off beef , as the press also covered the inefficient quality control by the government , and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying .
The disease can take up to 15-20 years to become evident in humans , so even if people gave up beef today , they would still have a chance of getting CJD .
However , giving up the products now would reduce the chances of being crippled by this disease in the future .
If a lot of people did give up beef products , this would have effects on the agricultural industry .
Cattle farmers will be hit particularly badly if no one wants to buy their meat .
It will affect other animals being sold for meat as well ; more people will want to buy the meat from sheep , pigs , and so on so they can still eat the same amount of meat .
The whole episode may send the price of beef down , so people will buy it and take the risk ( which must be tiny ) rather than forking out for more expensive meat products .
If no one wants to eat beef , then cows will only be bred for their milk , which means there will possibly be fewer cows in the future .
If cows are no longer required by the public for food , some abattoir workers may lose their jobs , and several butchers , for whom the money from beef products constitutes a considerable percentage of their income , may be hit hard by this .
The politicians still say it is safe and that they will continue to eat beef .
However , a lot of these people are old , and by the time the disease has developed in them , it wo n't really be too much of a premature death .
However , for us young people , is the risk too great ?
The original sentence `` I have n't stopped eating it . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .

There is no future for public transport in my country . Yes , it is a fact that it is overcrowded everywhere , besides the pollution with its huge numbers all over the city . Do not forget the rising prices of petroleum products ; nowadays , traveling by car is more convenient , safer , and cheaper .

Seven '' can be categorized as a chase and police film based on the several crimes that occur during the movie ; people consider it a gripping thriller .
The main characters were portrayed by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt . One of the most highly regarded facts was that the film grossed more than 330 million euros in 1995 when it premiered .
It is directed by David Fincher , who has also been in charge of `` The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , '' and it is a Paramount production .
The film narrates a series of murders that are related to the seven deadly sins ( lust , pride , wrath , sloth , greed , gluttony , envy ) committed by a psychopath who left a mark on each victim to indicate the sin for which they had been killed .
This led to the investigation by two policemen who tried to fit all the pieces of the crime together perfectly , but it was going to be more difficult than they expected .
I personally think that this film is fast-moving and spine-chilling . I found it astonishing , and I fully appreciate that there is no happy ending and that there are unpleasant moments due to some murder scenes .
If you like mystery films , I strongly recommend it .
I sincerely hope this review convinces the reader to watch the film . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Dear Joe ,
Thanks for your letter .
I 'm very glad you thought about visiting my country .
I 'm sure you will like it . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I can give you some tips for traveling , depending on what you like to do .
If you like museums , galleries , and architecture , I would recommend that you visit our beautiful cities , such as Wroclaw , Krakow , Poznan , Gdansk , and of course , our capital , Warsaw .
On the other hand , if you prefer nature and physical activity , you should consider going to our mountains—Sudety or Karpaty—or to the Mazuria region , which is full of lakes .
You may combine it , as well .
For example , you may go by plane to Warsaw , visit the city , then take a trip to the north , including our sea—which , unfortunately , is n't the warmest and prettiest sea in the world .
Honestly , you can skip it without hesitation .
The original sentence `` But our lakes are really worth visiting . '' is already correct and does not require any changes . However , if you want to make it more formal or add emphasis , you could consider : '' However , our lakes are truly worth visiting .
They are many possibilities there to spend your free time .
You can go horse-riding , swimming , kite-surfing , fishing , etc .

It seems like the sentence `` Ewa '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or the full sentence so I can help with any necessary corrections ?
The 20th-century invention that has had one of the most radical effects on people 's lives is the television .
During the 1950s , America witnessed the beginnings of a cultural revolution .
The era of Populuxe instigated a 'must-have ' ideology in the nation , and the most important 'must-have ' was , of course , the television .
The presence of television has brought about several crucial trends in our culture : the mass culturization of various groups , the commercialization of our lifestyles , and the rapidity and breadth of the information that reaches us .
Gathered around the tube , the American family learned the `` ideal '' way of life .
The original sentence `` But the picture of perfection was the same in every home . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
We all received the same information .
We all saw the same families—the Cleavers and the Andersons , etc.—telling us how we should behave .
Mother was always beautiful , Father knew best , and children had cute , silly , harmless problems .
As a result of this omniscient picture , a farmer in Iowa had an idea of what a family in New York consisted of . ( Note : The original sentence is grammatically correct , so no changes are necessary . However , if you want to improve clarity , you might consider rephrasing it slightly . ) Revised sentence for clarity : As a result of this comprehensive picture , a farmer in Iowa had an idea of what a family in New York was like .
People in N.Y. watched * Green Acres * .
Today , the same trend continues .
To white people , ghetto life is slightly less of a mystery .
The examples on television are blown up and exaggerated , but people get a general idea of different lifestyles .
Rather than several small , isolated cultures , the United States is moving towards mass culturalization .
And the presence of another 's reality in our homes is a major part of the reason .
Another effect of television on people 's lives is the commercialization of our lives .
Advertisements , which originally served only to inform people of their purchasing options , have developed into an art form.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
15-second blocks of our time are sold for millions of dollars , and as a result , the American population is made to laugh , cry , and oftentimes buy a product .
Finally , and perhaps most importantly , the citizens of America have experienced , with the advent of television , a great increase in the amount of information they receive , as well as a decrease in the time it takes for that information to reach them .
A hundred years ago , different sections of the country ( and world ) were isolated and separated by the time it took to mail a letter and print a newspaper story .
Today , we know within seconds , or in the case of the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion , we know live—immediately .
This abundance of information has led to a drastic alteration in people 's ability to react to major events .
Our view of the world is different ; it 's closer ; it 's in our living rooms .
A good example of this is the reaction to the Vietnam War .
The war was , indeed , unpopular with or without television .
But the reality of what we saw—the casualty counts , the bloody children under the American flag—did much to enhance the negative aspects of war .
Overall , the television has caused a radical change in our lives .
We are open to manipulation as well as stimulation .
The television is a powerful and dangerous tool .
It can greatly enhance and improve our lives , but it is most important to be aware of the fact that it is a manipulator .
The original sentence `` We must watch what we watch . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I do n't agree with the statement that there is no future for public transport because traveling by car is much more convenient .
When you decide to travel by car , it 's certain that you feel independent ; you can stop whenever you need , you can set off when you are ready , and that is why traveling by car is said to be convenient .
However , there are sometimes more important things than feeling comfortable when traveling , like money . Traveling by car is expensive , as the price of petrol is still increasing due to limited natural resources .
Although there are some places in the world where car users can not complain about the price of petrol , there are also many more areas where people exchange driving cars for commuting or riding a bike , as they ca n't afford owning a car .
The original sentence is already correct . However , if you want to make a slight adjustment for clarity or emphasis , you could say : '' Nowadays , we are much more aware of the environment . '' Adding a comma after `` Nowadays '' is optional but can help with the flow of the sentence .
Thus , we know that using cars is harmful to the environment . We are advised to take public transportation instead of traveling alone , as it means fewer exhaust fumes per passenger .
What is more , in multiple countries , there is a festival of public transport when people celebrate by traveling for free on public transport , and they are asked to leave their private cars in the garage .
To sum up , in my opinion , public transport will remain as long as scientists do not discover new natural resources of petrol or invent a cheap equivalent to charge cars with .
We do not care about the larger environment in China ; we only care about the environment in and around our own house .
We throw all kinds of household waste into the same basket , and the cleaner will collect it .
Corrected sentence : Sometimes there will be an odor remaining , as the basket is indoors .
We do not care about the air , even though air pollution is very serious in some parts of China .
We only choose the way that is convenient but may have a negative effect on our living environment .
Dear Jo ,
Spain has many beautiful places you ought to see .
I think you should start off in Madrid , so we can meet ; I 'll show you around .
We 'll go to all the tourist places , and you 'll get to try a lot of delicious food .
Then you should visit Barcelona ; it 's a truly beautiful city with many must-see places like the Sagrada Familia . Also , you 'll be able to go to the beach to relax .
From there on , I think you could follow the coast and visit cities such as Valencia , Cartagena , or Málaga during the summer and leave the inland cities for autumn .
As for working here , well , it 's not going to be easy . We 're having difficulties regarding that , but I guess you could find a part-time job at a restaurant or something . I could help you with sending your CV and all that .
And if everything fails , we can always ask my aunt . She owns a small shop in the city centre , and she 'd be more than happy to have someone help her out .
See you soon .
It seems like the sentence `` Sam '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or additional information so I can help you correct or complete it ?
Hi Jo ,
In my country , there are a lot of opportunities to work and have fun .
Italy is an enormous country full of culture and opportunities .
For example , I live in Jesolo , near Venice , and here there are businesses , other hotels , and other firms . If you want , you can also work as a tour guide .
On the topic of traveling , in my viewpoint , I think that the best thing is to start , for example , from the bottom of Italy and visit all the amazing cities in this country : Florence , Milan , Genoa , Rome , Venice .
There are also a lot of courses and other activities to do .
You have a lot of opportunities with universities as well .
Venice and Padova are the most important cities for learning .
It 's a great idea .
I hope I can see you soon , and I hope to be helpful in your decision .
As you may already notice , Warsaw is a beautiful and big city .
It was really hard to choose one place that you just must visit .
Obviously , it largely depends on your interests .
If you want to know Warsaw from a historical perspective , I recommend visiting the Old Town .
The Royal Castle is a magnificent historical landmark .
It would be helpful for you if you asked for a guide .
Honestly , I think it is very educational but a bit boring .
I am sure that , as young students , you will definitely appreciate something less educational but more interesting .
Your must-visit place is the National Stadium .
I have been there many times , and trust me—there is a lot to see .
It was built especially for EURO 2012 .
We were the host country , so we had to make as much effort as we could .
The first thing that attracts our attention is the interesting architecture .
It looks like a red and white basket—it refers to Poland 's flag .
The stadium is also equipped with a heated pitch , training pitch , façade lighting , and underground parking.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
There is even a railway station situated opposite , which was built in the same style as the stadium .
When you get there , you will not be disappointed .
There are trips with a guide where you will hear the story of the Stadium , which , in my opinion , is very interesting .
You will also visit the changing rooms where football players prepare for the match .
It is a multipurpose venue that is able to host not only sporting events but also concerts , cultural events , and conferences .
I highly recommend visiting this place .
It would be an unforgettable and fascinating trip .
It would also be a great windfall for all football lovers . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
You will not regret that , I promise . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Life changes could be possible in the coming years because a new way of life is emerging due to technological advancements .
When I look back , I realize teenagers are different ; they are looking for different things in their lives .
For example , when I was young , all students used to study for several years to become experts and get good jobs .
Nowadays , teenagers study for only a few years because they want to get a job quickly .
All around me , everything is changing quickly—education , way of life , way of thinking , technology—so I think all of this will bring about a change in the future .
In fact , I am looking forward to seeing this change , and I hope this change will be as good as I expect . Above all , I hope a big change in the health service will be made .
With economic development , a growing number of much-needed buildings are taking the place of areas of farmland , forest , and wetland .
As far as I am concerned , this phenomenon does more harm to citizens as well as animals than good .
First , the large-scale buildings bring various kinds of pollution .
The process of building produces a large amount of material rubbish as well as noise , which disturbs the lives of the inhabitants around .
At the same time , the glass covering the surface of the skyscraper reflects dazzling light .
Besides , the destruction of the habitat hastens the extinction of wildlife and reduces the diversity of species .
With no more trees and plants to freshen the air , the air pollution will become more serious .
What 's more , building more housing than needed is a waste of society 's resources .
To solve those problems , strategies should be taken by the government .
First , measures should be taken to protect the areas of farmland , forest , and wetland .
Each city should be promised at least the minimum required afforested area .
What 's more , the government should encourage investment in environment-friendly projects instead of housing construction .
The last is that .
Could you please provide more context or clarify what you would like corrected in the sentence `` Presents '' ?
In regard to a recent radio discussion about the positive and negative aspects of receiving presents such as luxuries , homemade items , or different life experiences , the decision is open to debate .
On the one hand , I strongly believe that people should receive presents at any time , whether it is for Christmas , birthdays , or just because you want to demonstrate to someone how much you care for them .
Live experiences are known for being the best type of present nowadays , as people have finally understood the importance of memories in our lives , instead of just collecting luxuries , clothes , or photographs .
Moreover , from my point of view , apart from having the amazing opportunity to receive this type of gift , you are also able to share it with the people you love the most .
In addition , I do not actually find any disadvantages to this type of present .
On the other hand , homemade items are also extremely agreeable to receive .
Not only are they made with true love , but they are also made , generally , with recycled products , such as glass , plastic , and even wood .
The main advantage is the fact that , as was said before , the item was probably made with passion .
However , the person who receives the present may not like it at all.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence `` That is the main disadvantage . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
These ideas have led me to my conclusion : the best presents to receive are experiences , as you will always remember them and share them with your family and acquaintances .
My teaching philosophy changed considerably when I finished this course , which was based on theories in second language acquisition .
Until now , my beliefs in teaching English have focused on the following opinions : ( i ) children should become familiar with English as early as possible , ( ii ) the teacher should motivate students so that they can achieve their target goals in learning the language , ( iii ) the teacher must be a good monitor in class , and ( iv ) the teacher must interact well with students .
My beliefs help me feel more confident about becoming an English teacher in the future .
First of all , parents should let their children learn English at an early age .
My first misunderstanding is that adults will acquire a second language better than children .
By reading about child language acquisition and SLA , I learned that the period during which people can best acquire a second language is in childhood ( McLaugh , 1978a , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p.123 ) .
Moreover , children between the ages of 5 and 9 , which is called the critical period , can acquire a second language naturally and do not need any special methods of teaching .
Children have better phonology than adults , and they display morphological sensitivity that adults can not .
However , older learners can be successful in second language ( L2 ) syntax .
Patkomski ( 1980 ) found that learners who learned an L2 after the age of puberty received lower proficiency scores than learners who started learning an L2 before puberty .
Therefore , in the future , I will encourage everyone to let their children become acquainted with English as early as possible to help them develop an accent like native speakers .
If I have a chance to teach children , I will create an active atmosphere with various activities that focus on communication skills and give students opportunities to engage with authentic input such as cartoons , music , etc .
Secondly , the teacher should inspire students ' motivation and raise students ' awareness in learning , so that they can achieve their target goals in language learning . When I was in grade ten , I did not have the willingness or motivation to learn English because of my parents ' obligation .
Consequently , my results did not meet the goal my parents expected .
Until I met a tutor invited by my parents , I had n't passed the exam in class with a high mark , but I now have the motivation to learn better .
The original sentence `` I want to become an English teacher . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Motivation is the second most important factor in SLA that enables students to achieve success in learning an L2 ( Skehan , 1989 , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p. 426 ) .
Students can use their time to do what they are interested in , and they will never get bored .
The more motivated one is in language learning , the more successful students will become .
It is really a long-term project that helps students improve their proficiency in a second language .
They need to observe a number of comprehensible inputs and do many tasks to achieve their goal .
As a teacher , I will make efforts to increase the students ' motivation frequency because of its changes over time ( Dörnyei and Ottó , 1998 ; and detailed in Dörnyei , 2000 , 2001a , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p. 428 ) .
Thirdly , the good teacher is the one who can organize all the activities in class well .
For instance , when I teach grammar , I have to determine how many structures I can teach in a lesson , and with some difficult grammar rules , I need to break them down to teach in stages .
Learners need time to memorize the new rule and acquire it in their learning system .
After teaching the rule , I will ask my students to work in pairs and communicate using the new structure based on my cue cards .
When they are working , I can hear their conversation and know not only what they say but also how they say it , so I can determine whether they have acquired the rules or are just using their learned knowledge .
Finally , interaction is also an interesting concept .
Gass ( 2003 ) found that `` language learning is stimulated by the pressure of communication and the relationship between communication and acquisition mechanisms .
Therefore , I will teach my students only in English . I will give them more opportunities to communicate with one another through the tasks I assign in class . Then , I will move around the classroom and correct their mistakes through negotiation , recasts , or feedback .
When observing their dialogue , if they make mistakes , I will take note , and after they finish their practice , I will correct them .
I advise against interrupting their speech because it is disrespectful to them .
In addition , if I always correct mistakes , my students will lose their confidence and they will not want to practice anymore .
This is my philosophy on foreign language teaching.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
These beliefs of mine help me examine what I am going to do in the future when I become an English teacher .
This course widened my knowledge a lot through the theories in the SLA book .
I think that students in schools of foreign language education must learn this course to develop a better philosophy of teaching .
The aim of this report is to describe how my town takes care of the environment and what people do in this regard .
Firstly , I am going to talk about what my town does .
The town is generally clean , thanks to the cleaning services .
Every night , roads are cleaned , and the rubbish is frequently collected during the day .
Even if the cleaning service is very efficient , people do n't usually take care of the environment .
They throw their wrappers on the ground .
In other words , citizens are n't completely worried about the place where they live .
The town has implemented a program to solve this problem by offering prizes to those who take action against this bad behavior .
As a result of this new policy , the town is now more attractive and cleaner than it was in the past .
Residents have changed their bad habits , and the image of the town has improved .
In conclusion , thanks to the new way of living , tourists are more attracted and curious to visit , and the town has reduced the costs of cleaning .
The amount of money saved is used to build new green areas throughout the town .
European nations have , over time , been linked together both in war and in peace .
These countries have since been moving closer together along more institutional lines .
One such demonstration of this has been the formation of the European Community , made up of the European Coal and Steel Community , the European Atomic Energy Community , and the European Economic Community .
In 1987 , the European Community adopted the Single European Act , in which the member countries committed themselves to the realization of a single internal European market by 1992 .
This act has raised questions in Britain about whether it will result in a loss of sovereignty for the country .
The lifting of trade barriers between the member states will enable the free movement of goods .
This economic union will not truly result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain , as it will simply facilitate the exchange of goods throughout Europe .
However , the fear is that the act will lead to decisions being imposed on Britain , since an important element of it is the commitment to majority rule rather than the previously common practice of consensus decision-making in the Council of Ministers .
This would result in the ability of individual nations to veto key decisions being restricted . The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
British sovereignty could be in danger if this union leads to a European government imposing its authority on Britain .
A centralised European government would inhibit Britain 's decision-making ability .
The recent incident of the European Parliament imposing its ideals on Britain points out the authoritative principles that it may be forced to accept if such a strong central body were created .
It was believed that Britain ought to halt construction on the Channel Tunnel link due to environmental concerns ; however , this action seemed to be an imposition on Britain 's sovereignty , as an external body was trying to tell the country what to do .
If the European Community were to bring in a single currency , Britain might be deprived of its sovereignty since it would lose its individuality , but more importantly , it would forget its bargaining position on the foreign exchange .
Currency decisions would be made by a central body , which Britain would have to accept .
If a single Europe should lead to British troops fighting on behalf of Europe instead of their own nation , most sovereignty would be lost .
It would mean a supranational force fighting as a whole , with no real difference between them ; it would not be a case of `` one force , one nation .
However , the state would still exist as an island , and people would always feel that they were British due to their roots and history .
Even if linked physically to Europe via the Channel Tunnel , Britain would still see itself as a separate country .
I personally believe that Britain will not lose its sovereignty if the union is based on an economic level of free trade between nations . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
However , if a strong European government were created that made important decisions for Britain , such as currency settlements and the running of its foreign policy , this would mean that Britain would no longer be an individual state with the power to make its own decisions and would hence lose its sovereignty .
The picture shows the process of making notes .
First , designing it is the most important process , as it involves escaping from copying ; then it can be printed when these are finished .
Make sure to check the quality of the sheets . If they are bad sheets , they will be destroyed ; if they are good quality sheets , they will be packaged and distributed .
The sheets conclude about cutting into separate bank notes , packing , and dispatching .
All of these are the basic processes . What we use is based on them .
Banks should make efforts to ensure security for the users . Through this process , we learn about banknotes , which are an essential part of our daily lives , as we use them to buy whatever we need .
This graph shows data on the amount of petrol used in the United States and the United Kingdom .
As it is known , these countries are some of the most powerful regions around the world .
Firstly , the United States line expresses that the majority of income percentage is spent by the poorest socioeconomic class .
Secondly , the amounts of money spent on cars are decreased by the wealthiest drivers .
However , this patron is not the same as the other place .
In the first place , we can appreciate that a percentage of capital used on gas is raised by wealthy people who live in the United Kingdom .
In the second place , the lowest incomes are reported among British citizens who are from a poor socioeconomic status .
Once and for all , either the United States of America or the United Kingdom has a similar patron .
According to the richest drivers , both lines are linked at the same place .
Dear Summer Camp Organizer ,
Hi !
The sentence `` This is Mimi . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I am an outgoing girl who enjoys getting along with people very much .
A few years ago , I was an elementary school teacher . I quit such a nice job to pursue my dream of becoming a nurse , but that would be an obstacle slowing me down in getting along with these cute little angels .
Thus , I have a profound belief in myself to do this job well .
By the way , I once joined a summer camp during my college years .
A role that was similar to this job , such as preparing meals and snacks , organizing games and surprises , and taking good care of them , and so on .
Though it may seem that having to do so much will be extremely exhausting for me , both my experience and instinct tell me that it would be a great time , leaving a beautiful memory in my life .
Either hardship and frustration could not change my decision ; only by trying the difficult can a person improve and find their way in life .
Above all , thank you for giving me such an opportunity to prove myself .
The original sentence is already correct . However , if you want to make a minor stylistic change , you could write : '' If I could be your partner , it would be my greatest pleasure .
I hope all of you enjoy a nice day .
Your friend , Mimi
Dear Lionel Messi ,
I 'm writing to you to persuade you with some information that you probably do n't know about .
I would like to say that you should give more money to charity , and I think you should be paid much less than you are now .
Firstly , I would like to say that you should be paid much less than you are now .
Because you get paid about £330,000 per week .
So , can you think about doctors and nurses ? They save lives almost every day , while you are not doing anything but just playing football and having some fun with your friends .
Therefore , you should be paid about £250 per game .
I think that is a huge amount of money , anyway .
In other words , I think you should give more money to charity because they need your help .
So I would say that in the 1960s , the wage limit was about £4-£7 per week .
It took about 20 years for that wage limit to double to £8-£14 per week in the 1980s .
When I was a kid , I was addicted to reading children 's stories .
In my teens , I used to read a lot of teen novels—so much that my mother used to reproach me for sitting too long reading instead of doing my schoolwork .
Luckily , I managed to do both , and I remember studying hard in order to get a real chance to read whatever I wanted with my mother 's consent .
Today , I realize how reading these stories has gotten me interested in writing .
I have always wondered how you start to recognize yourself as a writer and how you become an effective one .
Of course , a good writer must first be a good reader .
This is how I developed my ambition to write .
Reading stories , poems , and novels intrigued me to write my own .
Reading what my fellow writers here said about their experiences as writers—what pushed them to write , what made them go on , and how it made them feel—all of that gave answers to my questions .
More than that , I found insights into my own motives and goals as a writer .
I liked the close relationship between Shirley Carreira and her father and his library .
I enjoy being immersed in my books .
I love the feel and smell of them , and I prefer them over electronic versions every time .
They make you feel as if you are in touch with the magic they offer .
Books draw you in as if by a spell .
Michael is a very popular guy ; he is very intelligent and enjoys hearing stories about ghosts and strange things .
One day his friend told him to go to a cabin because strange things were happening there ; he accepted immediately .
On Saturday , they were walking around the street looking for the cabin , and they found a very old cabin .
They saw a horrible ghost , and he asked them two questions about his life , but the guys said nothing . The ghost was furious and said , `` Okay , the second question : How many years do I have ?
Michael was nervous because he did not know anything about it .
The ghost said , `` Michael told me , 'If you want to save your family or your friend , you can only save one ; the other person will die . '
Michael , after ten seconds , said this : `` I save my family . '' Michael then said , `` I am sorry , friend , '' and he ran far away . When Michael closed the door , he knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Although Louise felt nervous , she realized this was the opportunity of a lifetime .
That was the objective she had been dreaming of for many years .
If I make a decision , there will be no going back . I have to think it over .
The original sentence `` She was speaking to herself . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
She might let her parents down .
Their expectation was to send her to one of the most prestigious medical universities .
Alas , she was not sure if they cared for her opinion .
Due to her being a humanist , science was not the field that she was keen on .
The original sentence `` Louise had been given a chance to go abroad . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
She did not mind working long hours at entertaining places or earning little money .
Her spirit was crying because she was leaving her country for the United States .
She could not say whether it was a judicious feeling .
Generally , Louise was said to be an indecisive person , which could be noticed especially in such cases .
The advantages of leaving outweighed the drawbacks .
Her parents did not seem to be over the moon .
The girl convinced them and made them realize that there was no `` end of the world '' if she chose her own way .
Everyone is afraid of something , but a lot of people are more afraid of catastrophic events than of things like cancer .
Even though people are scared about these things , they continue to smoke and drink alcohol .
Some of our fears are instinctive , so we automatically respond to danger before we have even had time to think about it .
Our fear makes us act instinctively ; we react so quickly and save ourselves .
This type of fear is a necessary and life-saving response .
There are different kinds of fear , for example , phobias .
We experience phobias in situations that are not dangerous for our safety .
Many people have phobias , but they do n't threaten their lives every day .
Scientists say that phobias arise from negative experiences or traumas and that they are difficult to control , but they could be prevented with the right therapy .
We know what fear is thanks to experience and culture .
We are born with small and basic fears , but we know that things like terrorism are dangerous . Stories on TV , the internet , and newspapers increase the perception of risk from extraordinary events and often influence our fears , leading us to worry about things that never happen to us .
To better enjoy our lives without being oppressed by our fears , we must be objective as we watch programs on TV and pay more attention to what happens around us .
INTERNATIONAL SPORTS MONTHLY : Swimming
When I was younger , I used to swim , and this is my favorite sport now .
When I am swimming , I like the sensation of gliding through the water .
My advice would be to enjoy the water !
Enjoy your swim !
When you start to swim , you learn a lot of new techniques ; it 's like discovering a new world . I do n't swim to participate in a competition , but I swim to have fun .
The continual development of computer technology has created a great deal of controversy in modern times . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
There are widespread uses for computers in all parts of society nowadays .
One area that has drawn particular criticism is the computer games industry .
Since the early 1980s , when computers such as the Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 were introduced into the homes of millions of people , controversy has followed about their effect on children .
There is a widespread belief among parents that computer games hinder a child 's ability to learn . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers , such as the Amiga and PC , has served to deepen the `` problem .
The growing realism of the games appeals strongly to children .
However , parents feel that children should be broadening their minds by reading books , and that the computer games industry is encouraging children not to learn .
Computers have also been blamed for a fall in education standards among primary school children , a belief accentuated by the results of surveys which state that the vast majority of primary school children are unable to do simple arithmetic in their minds and rely on another computer , the calculator , to help them .
Another moral dilemma that computers have created is their role in the workplace . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
There are many people who fear that computers will eventually replace humans in the workplace .
The role of computers is already significant in employment areas such as accountancy , which require a specialist ability to calculate and manipulate numbers .
These computers have replaced humans , and such changes have sparked fears that the level of unemployment could vastly increase as a result .
As computers are more efficient than humans , do not require payment for their work , are less temperamental than humans , and will never have a day off because they are ill , it seems mankind is faced with a great problem .
Another claim made that suggests the human brain could become useless is that computers promote antisocial behavior .
The creation of the World Wide Web and the Internet has created concern that the human race will become unsociable .
The Internet allows you to correspond with people all over the world , and it also contains many other functions to , supposedly , make life easier for us .
The Internet also has another fundamental problem , according to many .
The belief exists that the computer age and its developments , such as the Internet , will remove the challenges from life . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
The human brain is constantly in need of being challenged to maintain itself ; however , with the introduction of the Internet , one could conduct their life without ever needing to leave the house , which many believe would menace society .
However , at the moment , the existence of computers is very much dependent on the existence of humans . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
No matter how much artificial intelligence a computer may be able to show , it still has to rely on the human brain to program it and to put it into operation .
Although there are plans to create computers that can program themselves ( which I personally feel is a very dangerous idea ) , the human brain still very much controls the computer and retains the ability to end the existence of computers at any given moment—a power , thankfully , that computers do not have over humans .
Since I have been studying in Australia , compared with China , I have realized there 's a significant difference in English study .
Formally , Chinese teachers would adopt cramming methods and pay attention to grammar and vocabulary . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct . However , if the intended meaning was `` formerly '' instead of `` formally , '' the corrected sentence would be : `` Formerly , Chinese teachers would adopt cramming methods and pay attention to grammar and vocabulary . '' )
However , in comparison , the English Academic Program ( EAP ) class encouraged independent learning and provided me with more opportunities to interact and converse with classmates .
After studying the EAP , I have found that time management is my weakness . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Therefore , I will discuss more about study strategies by reading related resources .
Time management is a crucial factor for productive learning .
Firstly , as described by the Academic Skills Unit ( 2012 ) , time management can be achieved by making a `` daily planner '' ( p. 23 ) .
So , I downloaded a daily planner and filled it with my study plans .
The original sentence `` Doing this helps to complete my daily tasks more efficiently . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Secondly , the research of Mark ( 2006 , p. 25 ) also states that scattered time in a day should be utilized and made more productive .
For instance , I looked for chances to talk to native speakers while waiting for the train or participated actively in conversations during my breaks .
I have learned that small bits of time added together can be used very productively .
In conclusion , by researching and comparing study strategies , I discovered that time management is crucial to achieving productive learning .
However , to become a better learner , it is also important for students to stay focused and motivated.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
In my future studies , apart from spending my time more productively , I will also set manageable short-term goals and review my plans regularly based on my study targets .
Hello , my name is Xiawu Kam . I am nine years old this year . Today , I am going to write about my favourite sport . My favourite sport is basketball because playing basketball is fun and helps keep me fit !
I started playing basketball in first grade , and now I am in fourth grade . That means I have been learning for three years ! My dad likes to play basketball too !
You know , I really enjoy this sport because it is very exciting !
If someone asks me which sport is the best , I will say to him or her that basketball is the best !
I really like basketball , and the teacher said to me that I am really , really good at it , so I always play basketball when I have free time .
I am on my school 's basketball team , the younger division .
I hope that this year I can join the older ones ' basketball school team !
I hope you can play sports like I do because it 's really healthy for everyone .
Thank you !
Thank you for reading my article . Goodbye !
Hi Mary ,
How about your life ? Mine has changed a lot since the last time we kept in touch .
As I told you , new people have come to the office .
We have established a wonderful relationship , especially with one of them .
He is very outgoing and very friendly .
He has a fantastic sense of humor , and he always makes me laugh , so I can forget the bad moments .
He is very polite , generous , and honest .
At work , he is a creative person . As you know , this is very important in our job ; he always has an idea when the rest ca n't think of anything .
However , he can be a bit immature at times .
He is very keen on sports ; his favorite sport , like mine , is basketball .
It 's a pleasure to be with him and to really enjoy his company .
I think we fit well together ; we have a lot of things in common and nearly the same likes and dislikes .
He is a talkative person , not me , as you know I am a bit shy .
The original sentence `` But I do n't think it will be a problem . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I must leave you now ; it 's time to work .
The word `` Love '' is already correct as a standalone word . However , if you intended to use it in a sentence , please provide more context or a complete sentence for further assistance .
Krashen 's theory is one of the most well-known and influential acquisition theories from the seventies .
Krashen presented this theory over several years in his works .
It was clustered in his great work , `` The Input Hypothesis : Issues and Implications '' ( 1985 ) , and it can be summarized in the following hypothesis :
The Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis
The Monitor Hypothesis
The Natural Order hypothesis
The Input Hypothesis
The Affective Filter hypothesis .
Corrected sentence : The Acquisition-Learning hypothesis is perhaps the most fundamental of all the hypotheses to be presented here .
It states that adults have two distinct and independent ways of developing competence in a second language . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
On the one hand , we have the acquisition that , according to Krashen , is the unconscious process children undergo from birth to develop their ability in their first language .
Language acquirers are not usually aware of the fact that they are acquiring that language .
They are not aware of the rules ; they speak without considering whether what they are saying is correct , and they do not stop to think about the errors they make because they do not believe they are doing anything wrong .
Some things `` sound '' good , and others do not .
On the other hand , we have the learning process , which implies the development of competence in the second language .
We use the term `` learning '' to refer to the conscious knowledge we have of the second language , being aware of the rules , for example .
Some theorists say that children acquire language naturally , but adults can not ; they just learn .
But according to Krashen , the acquisition-learning process suggests that adults can also acquire the ability to pick up languages ; this ability does not disappear when we grow up .
But at the same time , it does not mean that adults can always achieve native language levels or that they can access the same natural `` language acquisition device '' that children use ; it is so different .
The original sentence `` Acquisition is a powerful process in adults . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
Acquisition can not be converted into learning and vice versa .
They are two different processes . Acquisition is the most important one because we have to first control the mother language , and after that , the learning of more languages .
An application for teaching , according to this theory , could be that the optimal way a language is learned is through natural communication .
As a second language teacher , the best thing is to create a situation where language is used in order to fulfill authentic purposes .
This will help students , whether children or adults , acquire the language instead of just learning it .
Sport makes you test your limits .
You need to get ambitious , to improve , to convince .
For me , it 's simply passion .
It 's been forever that I 've loved basketball .
No matter if I followed professionals on TV or watched the students on the basketball court at school , the fascination always caught me instantly .
When I was 7 years old , my father used to motivate me .

Of course , I could n't make it .
The original sentence `` But I did n't give up . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
After many weeks , hours of training , and countless frustrating moments , my precision improved .
My father was stunned . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )

Honey , which I bought at the market near my home , has an amber tint .
That old lady looks a bit unwell .
Introduction .
First of all , this report is concerned with how you spend your shopping time in Albacete .
Albacete is easy to walk around , especially in the city center where you can come across most of the shops .
Could you please provide the sentence you would like corrected ?
In the commercial zone , you can find two small shopping centers .
All of them are on the main street , and each one is across from the other .
These two are not so big ; however , there are two or three small shops that are really original .
In contrast , I would mention two big shopping centers in my city .
All of them are on the outskirts , and they are :
Eroski is a place where you can find a lot of different shops .
Most of them are present in the city center too .
El Corte Inglés , where you can buy a lot of different brands across its 5 floors .
Conclusion .
From my point of view , the city center is more attractive than the shopping centers .
It is a little bit stressful for me ; in contrast , I prefer a relaxing walk looking at shop windows to an indoor shopping center .
But it depends on how much of a shopping addict you are .
Hi Dan ,
Thank you for your letter .
The original sentence `` How are things ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I am fine .
Would you mind going with me this Saturday ?
This Saturday is Mum 's birthday .
Yesterday , I bought her a new television , although she has an old one , but it is horrible .
This evening , I am inviting her to the cinema .
We are watching Spiderman , and after , we are going to Burger King because she likes it . However , I do n't like it , but there 's no accounting for taste .
Transport is an important activity in any country.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
The advent of technology has brought about drastic changes in means of transportation over time .
At the same time , transport has become a very important means of development for any nation , as all nations are moving towards globalization .
Public transportation has been playing a very important role in transporting people from one place to another .
The bulk production and marketing of cars have been reducing the role of public transportation .
Cars have become accessible to everyone .
The people prefer cars to public transportation .
This trend is very dangerous for the world .
This would increase air pollution .
Burning fossil fuels would increase , and this would increase air pollution .
Public transportation should be more attractive and cost-effective .
The original sentence `` Governments should encourage people to use public transportation . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
People should come forward to prefer public transport over their own vehicles .
The main problem in the United Kingdom is BSE , or as it is so-called , `` Mad Cow Disease .
It has been discovered that the disease can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of infected beef .
Beef production is a fairly large business in the U.K. , and it was necessary to discover more about this relatively new disease .
It was discovered that British farmers were to blame due to their various industrial techniques .
The disease was originally carried by chickens .
When the farmers killed the chickens for their meat , the remains ( bones and organs ) were processed to provide a cheap feeding product .
Unfortunately , the disease-carrying organs were not just fed back to chickens but to cows as well .
The cows contracted the disease ( in a slightly different form ) , and this was when `` BSE '' first came about .
The correct thing to do would have been to destroy the infected cows , bringing an end to a potentially life-threatening situation .
However , the farmers had money involved and did not want to stop .
When the infected cows were slaughtered for beef , their remains were processed and fed back to other cattle , spreading the disease further .
Unfortunately , unlike the chickens , the cattle were able to pass this disease on to humans through their beef .
The same industrial techniques are still used today , and with people in the UK becoming aware of the facts and more health-conscious , beef sales have decreased .
It is impossible to learn that you have contracted the disease for up to seven years . ( There is no correction needed for this sentence as it is already grammatically correct . )
And so , some attitudes of the public are : `` Why should I stop eating beef if I might already have BSE ?
Another public attitude is to ignore warnings , as there have not been any victims .
But it seems that the most popular option is to play it safe and quit beef entirely .
It seems that more and more families are opting for chicken , pork , or lamb as an alternative .
The original sentence `` It could have devastating effects on the agricultural industry as well . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
If there is a point where supply outweighs demand , farmers will produce less beef and make less money .
It is , therefore , conceivable to think that farmers will change from beef to an alternative product .
The doorbell rang while I was at home thinking about my lost little cat .
If you knew my pet cat , you would n't be surprised by my love for him .
His name was Timoshka , and he was n't as ordinary as other cats .
He was very intelligent and could understand my words .
He always knew my voice and my mood . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
If I remember correctly , I found him sitting next to my house on the street .
He was so dirty that I could n't see him in the darkness . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
His green eyes were the only things shining there .
I took pity on him and brought him into my home .
After having a bath , he changed into the white kitten , like a snowball .
The original sentence `` Well , I came to my door and opened it . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
There was a little girl who lived near me .
She was holding something small and dirty .
To my great surprise , this something was a cat !
This cat is mine !
The original sentence `` How happy I was ! '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The topic of environmental conservation and pollution prevention is very important not only in my city but throughout the whole country .
Many people are concerned about the increase in productive waste , garbage on the streets , and the lack of effective processing .
Nowadays , we still use traditional ways of recycling and rubbish gathering .
One crucial point is that we do not have a sorting system by type of rubbish .
We collect our waste in one bag and then throw it into the special containers that are placed in each city area .
From time to time , approximately twice a week , this rubbish is unloaded into vehicles and taken away to a recycling site .
It is difficult to imagine its further processing , but we know exactly that plastic and rubber waste is recycled .
Regarding other stuff , I think it could be put into containers and buried underground for conservation .
But there are few steps in this direction from our officials—a new recycling factory was built in the suburb and started to function last year .
But on the other hand , many citizens complain about the shortage of garbage baskets and containers on the streets of our city .
Sometimes we may see a scene where someone throws litter directly onto an embankment or a sidewalk in the city center , polluting the streets .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Right after she got to work , where she was nothing but a typically underestimated office worker , Anna was informed that she ought to go see her boss and prepare to be eaten alive because of the last report .
Once she set foot in his office , she was surprised by a crowd of people yelling 'Happy birthday ! ' .
Literally everybody was there , even her husband Adam , who was holding their disabled daughter in his arms .
I 've got a real stunner for you , Anna , '' said her boss , smiling like a Cheshire cat .
Due to my upcoming retirement , I have been ordered to find my replacement .
I told the management that you were the perfect choice .
Anna was thrilled to bits ; after all these years , she was going to become a manager !
And yet another surprise was about to happen . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Her skirt was being pulled out of the blue—Anna looked down and noticed her 5-year-old daughter standing still on her disabled legs .
It was truly astonishing ! ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
She fell to her knees with tears of joy running down her cheeks .
The original sentence `` She felt like she was on cloud nine . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Suddenly , her whole body started to shake .
Adam was standing at the hospital bed , staring at his wife 's convulsing body .
After many years in a deep coma , Anna 's family finally lost hope and chose euthanasia with aching hearts .
The teenage daughter silently shrieked and buried her head in Adam 's chest.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Shaking stopped , and the long monotonous sound confirmed that Anna had just left this world for a better place .
Now she could just constantly celebrate her birthday with her beloved family .
I must say that I strongly agree that shopping is not always an enjoyable experience .
To begin with , standing in a queue can give you a terrible headache .
Only ten minutes is just enough in the atmosphere of people shouting and haggling over every last penny .
Every once in a while , when you get home after shopping , it can turn out that you just bought a real pig in a poke .
The food might not have proper freshness , especially when it comes to dairy and meat products .
Not only can people not afford to buy expensive products , but they also spend too much money on useless goods .
It appears that the shop 's policy is very relevant in this particular matter .
It 's common to put products on special offer and hire some good-looking salespeople , so it 's almost impossible to refuse them .
As they say , you can shop till you drop !
On the other hand , it 's not necessary to purchase anything at all .
People are shopping around these days repeatedly in order to compare various prices , are n't they ?
It 's funny , but they always seem to be in search of the biggest bargain of their lives .
There is no doubt that browsing at the mall without buying anything can be as tiring as breaking the bank .
Introduction to a paper
The supply chain involves the management and provision of information across many areas in a company . It includes the selection of raw materials , the processing of these materials into finished goods , and the transportation of those finished goods or products to the end customers .
The main parts are the suppliers , production , and distribution .
One important task is providing information in each area to create a logical connection between the main parts to achieve the objective of selling a high-quality product while reducing costs and time .
The definition of a standardized process is the establishment of the same method to be applied in the production of certain activities or functions .
This method is already accepted with the required parameters .
A standardized product is the result of a standardized process.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
For example , the production of a Coca-Cola bottle in Brazil has to be the same as the production of a Coca-Cola bottle in Australia .
A standardized product must not have significant deviations in order to sell the same product to all customers .
Transport essentially constitutes our means of movement .
Cars ca n't always be afforded by all sections of society .
Public transport should be optimally run in accordance with demand .
Public funds should be allocated appropriately to ensure the maximum benefit to the public .
Drive down any street in urban America , and you will see young males and females , both black and white , driving Pathfinders , BMWs , Mercedes , and other luxury automobiles .
The original sentence is already correct . No changes are needed : '' How do these young people acquire the funds to afford such expensive rides ?
They dress in Karl Kani , Pelle Pelle , and Guess clothing .
They wear Cartier wristwatches and expensive Nike footwear . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Where do the funds come from to purchase these fashions ? ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
In many cases , the answer is simple : crime .
As unfortunate as it may sound , many youths are well aware of the fact that crime pays , and it pays well .
What alternative does an inner-city youth have when faced with inescapable poverty ?
The answer becomes apparent when he or she is often surrounded by criminals living larger than those taking a more `` conservative '' path to financial security . ( This sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The philosophy is simple : if you want it , go get it—at any cost .
The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes : The consequences are few , especially when one considers the shockingly low percentage of criminals who actually end up in jail .
The only danger that exists for a criminal comes from other criminals trying to take what 's theirs .
Police are no threat as they are far outnumbered ; it is virtually a game of chance as to whether one gets caught in an act of crime .
Fortunately for the criminals , these odds are drastically in their favor . The public calls for more police but refuses to pay the taxes needed to hire them .
The few police on the street are , thus , often left chasing criminals like a dog chasing its tail .
If a criminal is apprehended and , in an odd circumstance , is placed in jail for a non-violent crime , it is only a matter of time ( often a short amount of time ) before he or she is free to return to the wealth and comfortable living supported by burglary , mugging , dealing , or simple con games .
Jail space is reserved for murderers and rapists first ( as it should be ) , and when a murderer is convicted and sentenced , a dealer is put back on the street .
What an ordinary citizen imagines when they witness or hear about a non-violent crime is a thug bent on destroying society : killing babies , smoking as much weed as they can get their hands on , etc .
In reality , these criminals are merely working a job that pays them better than any other .
Why work at McDonald 's , where you are forced to work in a hot , cramped atmosphere , possibly with an overbearing boss who is stuck in a service job with no end in sight , making $ 5.00 an hour and shopping at K-Mart for clothes ?
The original sentence `` It is obvious that crime pays . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
The proof exists on any street in urban America : underprivileged youth rolling in luxury automobiles and stuffing wads of money into their designer jeans .
This is less of a choice than it is an act of taking advantage of an opportunity . The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
There are few alternatives for low-income youths and fewer obstacles in the quest for cash .
With violent crime rising and financial support for more police falling , crime will continue to pay .
If you are looking for a film about teenage first love to watch on a rainy day , I recommend watching * Endless Love * .
This is a remake of the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film , but instead of an age difference , there is a class difference .
Directed by Shana Feste , the film shows the throes of teenage first love , when David , the smart , decent , blue-collar guy who 's happy to go into business with his father as a mechanic , falls in love with Jade , a wealthy , sheltered , and studious girl with plans to attend Brown University .
The class difference between their families becomes a significant issue for both .
The film features Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde in the lead roles .
With his handsome face and gentlemanly attitude , and her perfect silhouette , both try to live with their different lifestyles together .
They will fight against everything to protect their innocent love .
Both act their parts perfectly , and there are brilliant performances from the rest of the cast as well .
Another thing about this movie that you will love is the cinematographic effects .
The romantic scenes and the music produce the perfect atmosphere for this type of film . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Finally , the script is wonderful , lovely , and touching , just like David and Jade should be .
If you enjoy cheesy love movies , I definitely recommend watching Endless Love .
It is undeniable that housing and transport networks are very important for us . However , plenty of people choose to build these in areas of farmland , forest , and wetland , which destroys the animals ' living areas and pollutes the environment we live in .
In my opinion , it is time for governments to take measures.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
To begin with , the energy in the world is limited . In other words , what we eat and what we need depend on farming and forests . If we run out of resources by building more large-scale buildings , there would eventually be a disaster .
As for the animals , due to the construction of large-scale buildings , they can not live in the forest and have to move to other places . According to the China Daily , it was reported that three elephants came into the town and ate the crops because their habitat was turned into roads . Many kinds of animals have to change their living habits , adapting to what people have done .
For the sea species , many visiting boats are put into the sea , polluting the ocean and leading to a high death rate .
To solve these intractable problems , the governments need to take measures .
For example , education is the key to raising people 's responsibility . The government can teach through public media . They can also allow organizations to go around the world and spread awareness about the problems in areas that have been destroyed . These are perhaps long-term solutions , but they are more realistic solutions than setting up yet another international organization .
One of the greatest inventions of all time is the television .
The invention that swept the world and changed leisure habits for countless millions was pioneered by Scottish-born electrical engineer John Logie Baird .
It had been realized for some time that light could be converted into electrical impulses , making it possible to transmit such impulses over a distance and then reconvert them into light .
And now it has become one of the most important forms of mass media .
Millions of people all over the world like to watch TV in their spare time .
It informs , educates , and entertains them .
It influences the way people look at the world and makes them change their views .
TV simply helps us relax after a hard day 's work by providing a great variety of entertaining and musical programs .
But there are some opinions that television is doing a lot of harm . ( There is no grammatical error in the original sentence , so no correction is necessary . )
People have begun to forget how to occupy their free time .
It prevents them from communicating with each other or from visiting friends or relatives .
And indeed , people used to have hobbies ; they used to go outside for amusement to the theaters , cinemas , and sporting events .
The original sentence `` They used to read books and listen to music . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Now , all free time is given to television .
Still , it 's not a good thing for children to be glued to the TV screen all day long .
It 's very harmful for their health and developing personalities because children prefer low-standard hits , horror films , or banal serials .
I 'm not a very passionate TV viewer .
In fact , I only watch those programs that I find interesting and helpful .
I relax when I watch musical shows , humorous programs , and TV games .
To my mind , all these things depend on the lifestyle of people .
Nevertheless , television has obviously changed society , and it 's probably used more than any other type of mass media .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
USA Summer Camps
I am writing with regard to your recent advertisement about USA Summer Camps .
I am interested in applying to and working for you .
I am 22 years old and have a bachelor 's degree in Education from the University of Warmia and Mazury .
My first language is Polish ; however , I am very fluent in English , which helps me communicate with children .
The original sentence is already grammatically correct and clear . However , if you want to make a minor stylistic adjustment , you could simplify it slightly : '' I am a sociable person and good at communicating with children of all ages , which I am sure would help me establish a good relationship with them .
In addition , I do have a First Aid certification , which can be very useful in this kind of camp .
As a teacher , I have a lot of experience in organizing sports activities , as I have been a teacher and have done similar things before .
The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . Corrected sentence : I am very knowledgeable about children and what they like to do in their free time .
I am confident that I would be able to help these children spend their time very actively .
However , I am good at cooking as well . I would be able to help you with cooking if you need any help .
I am very knowledgeable about health food , which I prepare very often at home on my own .
I would be more than happy if you chose me for this job , as I am certain I could make a valuable contribution to your summer camps .
The original sentence `` I look forward to hearing from you . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The phrase `` Yours faithfully , '' is typically used as a closing in a formal letter or email when the recipient 's name is unknown . It does not require correction if used in the appropriate context . However , if you are looking for an alternative or if the context requires a different closing , you might consider : Corrected sentence : Yours sincerely , This is used when the recipient 's name is known . If `` Yours faithfully , '' is appropriate for your context , then no correction is needed .
The sentence `` Antonina Chludzinska '' appears to be a name rather than a sentence that requires correction . If you intended to provide more context or if there is a specific issue with the name that needs addressing , please let me know !
My name is Caro Gutierrez , and I 'm from Mexico . I am the type of person who likes being around children , helping them with their needs to make things easier for them .
On the other hand , I have the ability to manage different sports , like swimming , basketball , volleyball , and softball .
I like to work in a clean and organized kitchen.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
I also like to have all the required kitchen tools handy , as well as the materials needed to prepare a meal .
I would enjoy working in this summer camp if you give me the opportunity , and I will be looking forward to hearing from you .
Dancing your problems away .
Dancing has been my favourite sport since I was very small.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
I learned from my parents how good it feels to move your body , and perhaps , without them , I would n't be in a street dance crew while taking ballet lessons right now .
The original sentence `` Does n't it just make everyone feel positive about dancing ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Throughout history , dancing has developed into an easy task , and everyone can learn it .
Recent studies show that whenever you are downcast or having issues , this sport stimulates your senses and has a great impact on your body and nervous system .
Recent additions include a healthy lifestyle , with an impact on your overall well-being .
It is a highly popular sport ; furthermore , it provides a lot of benefits .
Why not think about it ?
You 'll find that every time a rapid song comes up , you 'll need to move , even though you are sitting on a chair .
Instead of sitting down , you should take on the actual challenge and enjoy yourself .
Dancing is not intended for a specific age group , so everyone can start it .
The only advice would be to clear away the negative mood existing in your head , forget about the setbacks , and just wind down .
As long as you enjoy yourself , you 'll do excellently .
In conclusion , if you want a different kind of experience , go out and try it .
The family is the most valuable and priceless gift that someone can ever have .
The original sentence `` Having a family means having everything . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The strong and special bond we have with our family is unbreakable ; it is that one powerful and magical connection that lasts forever .
Friends come and go , but your family will always be there for you.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
When you 're at your worst , friends leave ; they become strangers overnight , and the next day they do n't even bother to say hello .
We will never know for sure how many of our friends are real ones and how many just fake a friendship , but there 's one thing that we can be sure of : our family is our best friend .
Friends ca n't always be relied on ; they may be willing to betray you and spread your darkest secrets around .
But you can count on your family 's full support whenever you need it.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
The family is where we grew up , where we were taught what love and kindness mean , the treasure that provided us with the warmth of a home .
We 'll never go and ask a stranger for help ; we 'll go and ask for our mother ’ s or grandmother ’ s wise advice because it is a thousand times more valuable .
I believe that the infinite love our family has for us is the most significant proof that we could never find a better best friend than our own family anywhere else throughout the world . Since the day of our birth , we were lucky enough to be given the best ones—our irreplaceable family .
A lot of teenagers are jealous of famous people , assuming that their lives are amazing and full of entertainment , joy , and fun .
The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . However , if you want to make a minor adjustment for clarity or style , you could rephrase it slightly : '' But what about the price they have to pay for their extravagant lifestyle ?
No doubt , young people are sure that celebrities enjoy a life most of them only dream about .
At the same time , they forget a very important thing .
Film and pop stars , politicians , and models are sometimes deprived of their privacy .
Moreover , hundreds of fans and paparazzi are hunting for them and sometimes even invade their private space .
Being in public is the main part of their profession .
On the other hand , they have families of their own , close relatives , and they have the right to their personal pastimes .
In my opinion , famous people deserve admiration due to their abilities and talents , though we should not only adore them but also respect them .
Much has occurred in the 20th century that has changed the way people live .
The invention that comes to mind as the most influential is the computer .
This invention of the late 20th century has forever changed the way people live and work . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The first computers were expensive monsters that filled an entire room and could perform only a few calculations per second .
With the advancement in technology and the move toward miniaturization , the desktop PC has evolved . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
These small , relatively inexpensive machines can do everything their predecessors did and much more.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Every day , new and exciting improvements are being made to enhance the performance of these tools .
The original sentence `` The impact of computers on the world has been great . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
They have changed the way people do business and have radically altered the way data and information are dealt with .
In short , the productivity of people has increased tenfold .
As we move into the 21st century , this fact will become more important .
The amount of information that is available in the world requires the use of computers to organize and extract that which is of interest .
The personal computer has played , and will continue to play , a major role in our lives .
The day is just around the corner when every human being in the developed world will have their own PC linked by cellular modem to the databases of the world , other PCs , and small digital assistants that will replace the printed page . ( Note : The original sentence is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . )
We have only just begun to realize the impact of this 20th-century miracle .
We are limited only by our imaginations .
And the future of this invention looks `` bright '' indeed .
The Cherepovets match factory `` FESKO '' is the leading company in the match industry .
It is the largest manufacturer of matches in the post-Soviet space and Europe .
At the same time , the company continues to grow by increasing production and strengthening its position in the market .
The first attempt to build the Cherepovetsk match factory was in 1948 , when construction of the factory on the bank of the Yagorba River began .
But a set of equipment for the production of the matches was not received .
The building was converted into a pipe plywood plant .
The match factory was built as recently as 1970 .
It was planned to buy equipment for production in Sweden , but eventually , the factory was equipped with domestic positional equipment .
Then the capacity of the Cherepovetsk factory was almost the worst in the industry .
The original sentence `` General reconstruction of the company began in 1981 . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Five `` Arenko '' automatic production lines were installed over three years , and by the end of the technology modernization , 70 % of the equipment had been replaced with brand-new ones .
And it was the beginning of an ascent into a leading position in the industry .
Since 2012 , `` FESKO '' has been carrying out a large-scale modernization , which has cost more than 200 million rubles .
The word `` Fitness '' is not a complete sentence . To correct it , you could expand it into a full sentence . For example : Corrected sentence : Fitness is an important aspect of a healthy lifestyle .
I would like to write about fitness because it 's a topic that is very interesting to me , as I live in a family where no one ever stops .
We usually go jogging ; it 's very healthy because the heartbeat can improve if someone runs consistently at a low speed .
But I know that jogging is a sport that many people hate because it 's tiring , so luckily there are infinite sports and each of us can choose the best one for ourselves .
I find aerobic very useful because it is based on physical exercise combined with music ; it 's very fun .
Unfortunately , most people do n't take physical exercise seriously because they are lazy . Anyway , I think that exercise should be an integral part of our lives .
The original sentence `` Obviously , fitness also depends on diet . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The healthier you eat , the fitter you become .
That 's a big piece of advice , but no one , including me , can give up on sweets .
Normally , people go to a gym to feel better and look better .
When you feel good about yourself , you enjoy life more , and you even have more protection against illness .
In fact , it 's for this reason that I extended the hours of physical education at school .
Sport helps not only the body but also the mind ; it helps to vent nervous energy and makes you feel free .
Do it for yourself . At the beginning , it will be hard , but in the end , you 'll be satisfied .
During my time as a teacher , I used to organize many group activities .
An example that I would like to provide is from my induction year , when I had to select and organize a group of students to represent the school in a charity campaign .
When I was selecting the group , I had to take into account each student 's background and motivations in order to have mixed and cooperative learning .
I used my good communication skills to explain what was necessary to accomplish the task and to deliver instructional materials .
I used plenty of positive reinforcement to encourage everyone to participate because they were a low-ability group with low levels of motivation , and they were not used to winning any challenges .
While the students were producing artwork to sell in order to raise funds , I supervised and monitored tasks , giving feedback on the completed ones and how they could be improved .
The campaign was a success , and the group was awarded the prize for being the most solidary students within the national context .
To begin with , obviously , everybody has a right to his or her own privacy .
There is no doubt that nobody wants to be stalked ; it is uncomfortable and annoying .
Even a star wants to have a little piece of quiet from time to time .
Surely a journalist or a paparazzo can be wrong in making their judgments .
It does n't matter if someone is a celebrity or an ordinary human being—I believe misleading gossip can ruin anyone 's life .
On the other hand , sometimes big stars would n't be so famous if they were n't chased by paparazzi .
As a matter of fact , it appears that some people want to be followed on purpose—to gain more fame , of course .
A bad reputation often seems to be the shortest way to bathe in glory .
Also , journalists deserve to earn a living and create good stories for their editors , especially if it is an exclusive on some big event .
Finally , a lack of privacy is an unpleasant price for staying in the limelight .
Famous people are forced to live with it , whether they like it or not .
I agree that celebrities should n't be constantly followed by journalists , but if they truly wanted their privacy to be respected , they would n't be involved in so many public scandals—there are people who just love getting others ' attention .
The diagram exhibits the changes during the last ten years in the quantities of immigrants to Australia .
It is separated into nine world regions .
The ones that show a significant decrease are Europe and Asia .
Moreover , India , the East , and America have only a very small decrease .
However , the populations in the regions of Oceania and Africa have really increased .
Overall , the chart shows that there has been a decrease in immigration . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Nowadays , there are a lot of famous people in our society who are facing a lack of privacy . In my opinion , they deserve to have as much privacy as possible .
They are ordinary people with the same needs as everyone else .
However , as they are famous , they receive a lot more attention from the media and fans than we could imagine .
The unstoppable vast amount of attention is usually a worse thing than a good one .
Everybody wishes to have as much privacy as possible .
It is unbearable for famous people to deal with journalists when they go shopping or anywhere else .
Can you imagine yourself going shopping and having a group of journalists take a picture of every step you make ?
I can guarantee that none of us would appreciate a lifestyle like that .
I can firmly say that famous people , like politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
Students finish school at the age of 16 .
They are very young , but I believe that young people should have the chance to go their own way .
In my opinion , it is a good experience for young people to leave school at the age of 16 because they
I have the chance to get practical experience .
People tend to look on the dark side .
I think there are two good reasons for going to work at the age of 16 . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Firstly ,
Because they are young and motivated , some students are glad to finish studying .
Secondly , it is important to learn as much as you can when you are young .
On the other hand , they are not old enough to know what they want to do their whole lives .
I think it is hard to get prepared for real life .
Teachers do their best .
But is it enough ?
However , the system is working , and it would be hard to improve it .
Everybody has the opportunity to make their own decision .
Nowadays , more and more people tend to have a healthy lifestyle .
Everybody wants to be healthy and to visit their doctor only once per year for a health evaluation .
However , living a healthy lifestyle is not easy ; it requires following the next steps , such as eating a healthy diet , exercising regularly , and getting enough sleep at night .
Physical activity is one of the most important aspects of a healthy lifestyle.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
Regular exercise not only keeps your body physically strong , but also reduces the likelihood of getting many health-related problems and increases tolerance to stressful situations .
It is a fact that physical exercise strengthens our musculoskeletal system .
Well-developed and strong vertebral muscles keep our body in the correct vertical position , so vertebral deformation will not develop and back pain will not occur .
Indeed , doing a special type of gym activity called `` cardio '' improves blood circulation in internal organs and the heart .
Accordingly , the risk of cardiovascular diseases decreases .
Also , everybody knows that strong positive or negative emotions , due to certain hormonal reactions , have an impact on heart function .
In a regular person , heart rate and blood pressure can increase dramatically and even cause a stroke or a heart attack .
In trained people , the intention of heart contractions and stroke volume will increase .
The heart rate will change slightly .
Thus , trained people have a better tolerance for stressful situations .
Corrected sentence : The food that we consume is the next issue of a healthy lifestyle .
A healthy diet consists of balanced , fresh , and unprocessed food with the proper amount of calories .
Our daily food should include enough protein , carbohydrates , fat , minerals , and vitamins , which are required for normal body functions .
For instance , lack of protein causes muscle weakness ; lack of vitamin A causes myopia and night blindness .
Also , if food is not fresh or not prepared properly , it can contain bacteria or parasites .
For example , spoiled milk products can lead to gastrointestinal tract dysfunctions , and improperly thermal processing seafood can cause leptospirosis .
Moreover , fast food should not be on the table .
Avoiding eating fast-food products , we diminish a risk factor for getting some serious diseases , such as cancer .
French fries are just one example .
Fries are usually cooked in a large amount of oil , which boils all day .
According to science , in addition , we have to limit the size of portions and consume only the amount of calories according to our individual needs .
In this way , we will never have problems with obesity .
Being healthy is fun !
You may think being unhealthy is only about being fat , but that 's not true .
Being unhealthy leads to multiple diseases , such as heart or breathing problems , and even depression .
Besides this being very awful , staying healthy is a good way to feel good about yourself , find new interests , and make new friends .
Here are some suggestions for those who want to be healthy :
Instead of going to a fast food chain during your lunchtime , why do n't you try going to our cafeteria on campus , which offers a variety of salads and soups that are not only healthy but also really tasty ?
Did you know that our athletics team is accepting registrations ?
This could be a great way to find new teammates who would help you develop some skills .
Do n't waste time ; run to get the last spots .
Right outside our campus , you can find a gym that offers a lot of activities , such as spinning , aerobics , or even swimming lessons .
Also , because you are studying at this college , they will give you a big discount !
Are you what is called a couch potato ? Get up off the couch , turn off the TV , and go to the park on the campus .
There you can breathe some fresh air while you read a book , play frisbee , or defend your point of view with other students .
Traveling by car has become increasingly popular nowadays .
However , public transport will still survive .
First of all , public transport like buses and subways is much cheaper and less resource-consuming than cars .
The public transport can provide an affordable option for those who can not afford to buy fancy cars .
It 's also more convenient to travel by public transport , like airplanes , for long distances since traveling by car for a long distance can be really exhausting and inconvenient .
Last but not least , public transport is more environmentally friendly than cars , which means public transport will play an even more important role as environmental problems become more and more severe .
If I could dream about an imaginary transport , the machine would be long , wide , and white .
I must be lying inside it to travel , and the most important thing is that I 'll fall completely asleep in a few seconds .
I will be awake again when I arrive at my destination : The Spanish Golden Century .
There , the dramatist Lope de Vega will be waiting for me to show me how plays took place during that period of time when the theater was the best entertainment and the buildings were great .
Maybe I 'll act like I did in the past .
Now I 'm going to write a film review .
The name of the film is `` Bangalore Days .
It is a film by Anjali Menon , who directed the film Ustaad Hotel earlier .
It is a tale of three childhood friends from Kerala . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Kuttan , Kunju ( Diviya ) , and Arjun .
They are typical small-town youths dreaming of the big city , Bangalore .
Kuttan himself narrates the story .
He starts with a punch line : when they are in Kerala , they do n't like it , but when they are out of Kerala , they miss it so much .
At the beginning of the story , Kuttan gets a job in Bangalore , and Divya completes her BBA from a local college .
She is planning to go to a bigger city for an MBA .
At that moment , an astrologer recommended Divya to marry soon .
So an arranged marriage happened .
Her husband 's name is Das . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
When Das first met Divya , he said that he had a serious relationship and he did n't think he was over it .
But it did not hinder the marriage .
From the first night of the marriage , Divya found something was very wrong when Das took off all his wedding clothes , put on a sleeping gown , and said he had some office work to do while holding a laptop .
When they went to their apartment in Bangalore , Das showed them a room and said that it remained locked with old stuff , so they could use the other rooms .
Das keeps himself busy with office work all the time ; besides , he shows an attitude that he has no time for others .
Though Divya and he are a married couple , he has never shown any interest in Divya .
At the beginning , Divya always tried to match with Das , but she could not .
So she is losing patience and developing a `` do n't care '' attitude .
Das never has feelings for Divya .
The original sentence `` So she keeps herself busy with her friends . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes . However , if you are looking for a variation or improvement , you could consider adding context or detail , such as : '' So , she keeps herself busy by spending time with her friends . `` This version adds a bit more detail about how she keeps herself busy .
Meanwhile , Arjun came to the city . As he is a motorcycle expert , he found a racing club named Storm Riders and started working as a motor mechanic .
He can ride a motorbike exceptionally well ; hence , he won a race with the club owner .
Later , the club owner banned him for one year .
But the coach of the club keeps an eye on him . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Meanwhile , Arjun falls in love with an RJ named Sarah , who is disabled .
The relationship faces many challenges .
Sarah 's mother does n't approve of the relationship .
They want to go to Australia .
The relationship between Divya and Das is getting worse .
At this time , after a quarrel , Divya opened the locked room and found that the room was a keepsake of Das 's past relationship .
Now Divya understands why their relationship is not working .
Then she discussed it with her two best friends , Arjun and Kutty .
These two become very angry .
Later , Divya goes back to her parents ' home .
Her family blamed Dad and his family and wanted a divorce .
Kuttan wants to marry a girl who is a traditional Keralite , respects Keralite culture , and is also beautiful .
At this point , Kuttan made an urgent air trip to visit his sick father .
At the plane , he met Meenakshi , one of the flight attendants .
When Kuttan saw Meenakshi , he thought he had found his dream girl .
Corrected sentence : Later , they met in a mall and suddenly , at that time , they exchanged their phone numbers .
The relationship began to grow .
Later , he found that Meenakshi was not a traditional girl ; rather , she was a trickster .
It broke his heart . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Eventually , he found Indian traditionalism in a foreign girl .
One day , when the yearly racing event comes , the coach tries to persuade Arjun to attend the race .
At this time , Arjun found out that Das was the racing legend of the club .
Everybody respects and loves Dad .
He gets to know the story of Das from others .
After a terrible accident , Das 's girlfriend died .
After that , no one saw Das . Arjun shared the thing with his friends .
Divya immediately went back to Bangalore and started her MBA .
Now the days and Divya are coming closer .
In the race , Arjun became the champion .
On the same day , Sarah is leaving for Australia .
After the race , Dad drove them to Sarah 's home to halt her .
Thus , the story finished happily .
I love playing tennis.The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
I think it is one of the most complete sports in the world .
I started playing tennis when I was 10 years old . My father taught me first , and then I had one of the best teachers in the country .
I was a great player ; I won several tournaments , and I had a lot of fans .
My game was based on endurance ; I could play for hours . I had just one thing in my head : pass the ball no matter what .
My height was an important advantage too ; I could reach all the balls from one corner to another .
When I talk with kids who want to start playing tennis , I always tell them that tennis is about consistency . It 's not easy ; you ca n't watch a game on TV and expect to play just like them in a couple of days . It does n't work that way .
You must train at least two hours per day , eat the proper food , avoid alcohol , and get enough sleep .
If you can do that , you will be a future tennis champion .
Good luck .
Throughout my entire life , technological breakthroughs have dazzled me .
In school , I was passionately indulged in my studies , trying to understand how electrical gadgets work .
On the roads , I observed cars , wondering how they moved .
I enjoyed using technical devices and electrical gadgets , even in bed .
However , when I was a teenager , my mother had to undergo a surgical operation to remove part of her liver .
This type of surgery has a low mortality risk due to the low likelihood of human error .
Although the operation was successful , my mother was healthy again .
The doctor had to remove her ovaries during the surgery after he accidentally caused a hemorrhage in them .
He made a human mistake , and my mother barely survived her liver operation with the unannounced removal of her ovaries .
The overwhelming panic that I felt during her operation and the pain we went through as a family after the surgery have changed the shape of my life forever .
Due to a human mistake , neither my life nor my mother 's life was ever the same again . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Ever since that day , I have wanted to be an engineer to design a robotic system that can perform surgeries with high accuracy , thus eliminating the human error margin .
I studied mechatronics engineering with the hope that one day , with enough knowledge and willpower , I would be able to work and contribute to the field of engineering .
The original sentence `` I am both hardworking and resilient . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Living in my city , Aleppo , located in Syria during the war , has broadened my vision and expanded my horizons .
I want to contribute to the improvement of my country and fix what the war has broken by providing inexpensive prostheses for the injured victims of war .
Therefore , a master 's degree would enable me to put a smile on the face of a child who might have lost his legs , but this does not necessarily mean he has lost his right to play and enjoy his childhood .
I believe in lifelong learning , and I am enthusiastic about learning European languages in general , and German in particular .
After finishing my master 's program , I will prepare for my Ph.D . Besides studying in academic settings , I will continue learning and improving my German language skills while exploring Germany in my free time to learn about its enticing and wonderful culture .
I believe that we , as humans , are all equal , and we all have the same dreams and hopes .
Thus , I want to do my best to help every life on planet Earth lead a healthy and happy life .
Not just the present generation , but also the entire human race is affected .
I think that after attaining enough knowledge in the technical field , I will be able to extend the life expectancy of the human race with robots and systems that can work hand-in-hand to ensure human safety .
Designing more intelligent systems to organize traffic or developing robots that can conduct surgeries with lower risk are both examples of technological advancements that can greatly benefit society .
Finally , I have to say that I feel the urge to help every human being that I come across in my life , regardless of their race , gender , or ethnicity . I do think that we all have the power inside us to achieve our dreams in life ; we just need a strong motive and enough dedication .
The sky is the limit .
The computer has been a major technological invention of great importance .
We are able to perform tasks such as writing letters at the push of a button , using programs , and even playing games with these masterpieces .
A person of any age can use a computer for business or pleasure , and generally , the machine is a superb enhancement in our ever-expanding , business-oriented world .
With health experts , however , our marvellous machine is seen as provoking problems to our health that must not be ignored .
Apart from being a necessity to some , it makes human beings lazy to a certain extent and thus allows us to use our brains less and less .
It is true to say that a computer is able to perform many hundreds of useful tasks to which our brains are completely indifferent .
But we ought to ask ourselves , `` What happens when the computer-oriented world collapses ?
We would then have to use our brains . '' The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes .
It is not sensible to put all our efforts and hopes into a machine that runs on electricity .
The brain must be exercised to allow for this possible clanger if we are disconnected from our precious computers .
We must educate ourselves more , and our children especially , who are at the forefront of tomorrow 's technology .
Hello , Jo .
In my opinion , my country , Spain , is the best place to travel .
Here , you can find a lot of wonderful cities and many places to visit .
I would like to recommend two cities for you to visit .
Firstly , you must visit Sevilla .
Sevilla is in the south of Spain .
The sentence `` It is a large city . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence `` It has a hot climate . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
People there are very happy , and they celebrate their parties in the street .
It is very important to stay there in spring .
Toledo is the second point I want to discuss .
Toledo is in the center of Spain .
The original sentence `` It is a historical city . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Toledo was built on a mountain that has a river around it .
Toledo was a place where three cultures lived .
It has an important historical center , with many museums and places to visit .
Here in Spain , it is very easy to work if you want .
Although there are many people without a job , it is known that there are many temporary jobs available .
In summer , bars and restaurants need many waiters and cooks .
These employees are temporary , so you can get some money for your trip .
The original sentence `` Warm regards . '' is already correct and does not require any changes . It is a common closing phrase used in letters and emails .

Dear Prime Editor , Recently , a significant number of local people have been arguing about the construction of the recycling plant .
Like many others , I strongly believe it will involve several positive aspects for everyone .
In fact , almost all the residents in our local area are inclined to believe that building such a huge recycling plant will provide the jobs we need .
Also , our neighborhood used to be one of the most attractive areas , but now there is an unbearably large increase in the amount of garbage , which we want to get rid of .
Another reason is that protecting the environment has been very difficult to do , but by building the recycling plant , it will be much easier to keep our environment well .
Recycling not only saves the environment but also saves you money , as buying recycled items is a lot cheaper .
The government has a massive responsibility to encourage people to recycle .
Finally , in my opinion , building the recycling plant is a great idea .
Factually , it is beneficial to both humans and the environment . Yours faithfully , Banhi Mohamed .
Dear Tom ,
I am writing to you to apply for the summer camp job . I usually work with children of these ages because I 'm a teacher , and when I finish each day , I usually go to prepare food for many children at the same school .
In my free time , I like preparing activities for children that are normally related to sports and evening activities .
I 'm considered an energetic and cheerful person ; I put all my energy into the work that I do . I 'm a hardworking person .
If I have anything to do , I always win .
I 'm interested in this job because I like to learn and improve my skills and enhance my resume .
I think that I will be a suitable person for the job because I have all the qualities you need in a person .
Thanks for your consideration .
The sentence `` Bye . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
If ever there was a false statement , it is : `` There is no future for public transport , because traveling by car is so much more convenient .
Traveling by car releases carbon monoxide , which poisons the atmosphere and contributes to global climate change .
The original sentence `` It is killing the planet . '' is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes .
Our love of convenience will cause the end of our beautiful planet and , of course , us as well .
In most large cities around the world now , cars are actually inconvenient , and most people rely on public transport to get around .
The Paris Metro , New York Subway , and London Underground are all an integral part of these teeming cities .
In many cities , there are not only massive traffic jams , but there is nowhere to park your car once you get to your destination .
If there is to be a public , they will need to use and enjoy public transportation .
The model does need some work , however , such as smaller and more frequent buses during most of the day , with the big buses only coming out during rush hours .
The future is all about public transport , with the private gas-driven car becoming a thing of the past .
If we make it past this disaster , we will be saying , `` What were we thinking ?
Television has become an important part of our daily life , and it has both advantages and disadvantages .
Nowadays , television is not only a source of entertainment and advertisements but also an impressive teaching aid . Its educational importance ca n't be underestimated as well .
It is becoming popular in schools ; also , its audio-visual quality makes educational programs more effective and interesting .
Hence , schools are making use of its potential for improving education .
Most schools in the United States of America have television sets , and lessons in the classroom are often boring , which does not appeal to most students , so they do not attend them .
To create interest in lessons , television is a good source .
In subjects like science and geography , there are many things that can be shown on television .
The original sentence `` Hi , Nazanin ! '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Thank you for the postcard . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
The original sentence `` It was very nice of you . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence `` How were your Easter holidays ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
My holidays were rather interesting , even extraordinary . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
As you know , this year I celebrated Easter in Germany because the Easter vacations were very short .
So , I tried to celebrate Easter according to my Ukrainian folk laws .
Traditionally , in the morning , we have Easter Mass in the church , and then Easter breakfast .
Before the mass , you must prepare a basket that contains traditional Easter food and bless it in this Easter mass .
It was not so easy to find all the foods .
But at least Easter came .
The weather was amazing ; it was warm and sunny , in spite of the fact that the day before it was cold , windy , and haily .
My two friends and I went to the railway station because the mess took place in Erfurt .
It was funny to take the basket through the town because it was windy , and I had to carry the basket very carefully to prevent the napkin from blowing away .
The meeting was supposed to start at 3 , but it did n't begin until almost 4 .
The mess lasted approximately two and a half hours , and then we expected to get home quickly because we were rather hungry .
But a little surprise awaited us ...
We had taken only a few steps when it suddenly began to hail .
In a few minutes , it looked like it was winter outdoors .
It was not so easy to get to the railway station because it rained and hailed , and we did n't have any umbrella at all .
So , we missed one train and had to wait for nearly an hour .
We got home only near 8 , and we were very hungry , so we ate our Easter supper .
We had a great time together .
The next day , my friends came to visit me .
The original sentence `` So it was really cool . '' is already grammatically correct . However , if you want to provide more context or make it part of a larger narrative , you could expand it . For example : '' Because of all these factors , it was really cool . `` Or , if you want to maintain the original structure : '' It was really cool .
I hope my story was not too long .
Have you already planned anything for next weekend ?
The original sentence `` We could go anywhere together . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The original sentence `` I 'm waiting for your answer . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
The sentence `` From : Mercè '' appears to be an incomplete fragment , possibly indicating the sender of a message or letter . If you are looking to correct or complete it , you might consider providing additional context or content . For example : - If it 's the beginning of a letter or email , you might continue with the message : `` From : Mercè , Subject : Meeting Update . `` - If it 's part of a list or document , you might clarify its purpose : `` From : Mercè , Date : October 10 , 2023 . `` If you have a specific context in mind , please provide more details so I can assist you better .

Subject : Your family
Hi Marta ,
I 'm writing because I want to invite you and your family to Menorca this summer .
I think that you can come during the first week of July .
You can stay at my home in the countryside .
When you visit , we can go to the beach in the morning and take a walk from Ciutadella in the evening . Do n't worry if you do n't want to spend a lot of money because we can have lunch and dinner at home .
The original sentence `` I 'm speaking with my daughter . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .

It seems like the sentence `` Mercè '' is incomplete . Could you provide more context or the full sentence so I can help with the correction ?
We are experiencing a severe economic crisis in Spain .
There is high inflation and a large underground economy . As a result , the education system of our country ranks among the poorest in Europe , along with the United States and the UK .
The economic crisis is principally affecting education .
Politics is cutting back the aid for studying .
Corrected sentence : There are more and more students who ca n't study because they receive little economic help .
One solution to solve this problem is to cut down on the salaries of people such as footballers , politicians , and commentators of trashy TV shows like Salvame .
Society is sure that if they do this , we , the students , will get enough money to study .
The authorities have been working really hard to find a way to take care of the environment in the community .
They have a program in which the first rule is that one day per month , all neighbors go out to clean every street .
Corrected sentence : People have to separate the garbage into organic or inorganic , if they do n't do it .
They have kept the garbage in their house , yet they still follow the rules .
People aboard the garbage truck do n't receive the garbage .
This line graph shows the number of visitors to a selection of different museums and galleries in Sharjah . Overall , the greatest number of visitors was to the Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilization , and the least number of visitors was to the Maraya Art Centre .
The most noticeable aspect of the data from the Sharjah Art Museum is that it started in 1991 and increased slightly until 2001 , then rose sharply to reach a peak of approximately 3.2 million in 2006 . Secondly , if we look at the Sharjah Calligraphy Museum and the Sharjah Archaeology Museum , we can notice that both lines started in the same year , 1991 . The Archaeology Museum started with a number of 0.3 million visitors , then remained steady until 2001 , after which it increased sharply . The Calligraphy Museum started with 1 million visitors and decreased slightly by 1996 to reach 0.9 million visitors , then remained stable until 2006 , after which it dropped to 0.5 million .
Nowadays , public transport seems to be one of the most suitable choices for us to travel .
This may be regarded as quite a difficult problem to solve .
More and more families are now getting used to buying individual cars rather than using public transportation .
On the one hand , for our daily lives , it is worth buying a car .
We can use it for a wide range of activities , such as taking our children to school , going to our place of work , doing the shopping , and , of course , going on family vacations .
Prices might seem more expensive at first , but later on , cars tend to become very affordable .
But on the other hand , with climate change ahead of us , we must ensure that every single person contributes to making our environment a better place for future generations .
For instance , we have many examples proving that public transport itself is improving our environment .
London 's subway , for example , carries more than one thousand people each day .
People barely use their cars in crowded cities , which is why public transport still has a unique role in our daily lives .
Furthermore , public transport is developing new environmentally friendly engines that may provide better conditions and cleaner air for our people .
Investing in this sort of transport is now becoming a traditional activity for those who have enough income to care about society .
To sum up , people will still be using public transport in the future , although new changes must be made to ensure its survival .
First of all , try to organize your sport and music time and do your best to do both .
If you 're convinced you can not do both of them , think about two things : first , in which activity you will have a better future , and second , which one of these activities you like the most . In my opinion ,
I think sports will give you more benefits than music because you do what you like and exercise at the same time .
I really hope this helps you .
Sincerely , Hector
Many people believe that being famous is fantastic ; everyone on the street wants to get a picture with you , and you have many fans .
Being popular is cool because everyone knows you .
Another good thing about it is that you 're easily distinguishable .
On the other hand , all the time you 're observed by cameras , paparazzi , and fans , even when you 're at home or on holiday with your family .
You ca n't even go shopping without being noticed . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
And I 'm sure that the next day , your photo will be on the front page of the daily news .
What 's more , journalists are just waiting for your mistake , inaccurate statement , or compromising behavior .
Moreover , especially politicians are exposed to being attacked by brazen journalists who hunt for them .
In my opinion , famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them .
Nowadays , everyone wants to know what a private idol 's life looks like , so I think it 's very hard for famous people to keep their own lives to themselves .
Nowadays , everything in the world is very developed , such as education , transport , people 's lives , and so on .
I 'm sure that in the future these will develop more .
In the future , education will grow a lot ; I think it will change in terms of how to teach and what to learn .
Scientists will create a pen that can write in space . With this pen , teachers wo n't need to go to a place with a board , as they can write anywhere they want . Additionally , a device will be developed to help students who ca n't go to school . This device will include the lessons and allow them to discuss with their friends in a comfortable way .
In the next 50 years , cars that use the sun 's energy will become popular , and cars that cause environmental pollution will disappear .
The amount of people who walk to school or their workplace will increase .
This is a good change .
People 's lives will change , too . At that time , maybe each family will have a robot that does housework .
People do n't want to spend a lot of time on housework ; instead , they can relax after work or engage in different activities .
People 's lifestyle will be more comfortable .
I believe there will be many changes in the future .
All about me .
Hello , I 'm Ailsa Dael Lam , and I 'm thirteen years old .

The recent developments in the field of genetic engineering have come largely as a result of discoveries made and techniques designed during this century , starting with the discovery of DNA and the mapping and understanding of its structure .
The manipulation of genes is an incredibly important and dangerously powerful ability that can not be left simply to the scientists to look after .
We are all now affected by the results of genetic engineering , be it for medical reasons or commercial ones .
Tomatoes are designed and engineered to last longer , apples to grow bigger , crops to ripen later to allow for transport time , and pigs are used to grow insulin for human use .
The list is enormous .
Along with the many advantages , there are dangers .
New biological weapons are being developed all over the world ; for example , the ability to transfer the genes that cause cancer into a simple disease such as the common cold could , without much doubt , wipe out a significant percentage of the human race .
There need not be a war for something disastrous like this to occur ; these genetically engineered microbes could be released accidentally while being investigated in an unsealed laboratory .
If we are going to accept the advantages that come with genetic engineering , we also have to take responsibility for the disadvantages . The stakes are too high to leave this job to the scientists , and they ca n't be expected to take moral responsibility for people who misuse the discoveries and inventions , thereby causing disaster .
Governments should ensure that money is invested not only in the research of genetic engineering , but also in ensuring that the results of this research are kept safe .
I recommend visiting a Guido mine . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
It 's an old mine that was converted into a cultural zone in our city .
Of course , it 's still a mine , so you can see all the major equipment used . Zabrze is located in Silesia , an area known for coal mining .
It was set in 1855 by Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck , so the mine was named after him .
It has such a rich history that I ca n't just tell you everything in one e-mail .
I can say only that the mine is divided into two levels : 170 and 320 .
The first one , level 170 , presents methods of mining , the work of miners in the late 19th century , and the history of that industry in Silesia .
This level is designed as an interactive form of sightseeing , supported by lights and sounds .
The main assumption is to shock the visitor and evoke his feelings , and , in my opinion , it surely does .
The visitors may be surprised by the noise of the crackling ceiling or the rats ' squealing .
There are also many exhibitions organized throughout the year .
A highly qualified guide is waiting for every group of visitors , and he 's ready for even the most serious avalanche of questions .
On the path of sightseeing , you can also find a chapel—a place which is very important for every minor and , of course , a place where important celebrations take place .
On level 320 , which resembles a real mine , you can see a longwall coal-cutting machine while it 's working .
The original sentence `` You can also touch real coal with your hands . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
Many concerts , exhibitions , and theater plays are organized too .
And if you get hungry , you can try something regional—you can be sure that the cooks wo n't let you starve to death .
I think that the Guido mine is well worth visiting . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Love ,
Please provide the sentence you would like corrected , and I 'll be happy to help !
Nowadays , the airplane is considered an ordinary aspect of our lives .
Its chief purpose is to safely transfer people from one place to another .
However , a few decades ago , we had a very limited notion of such a technology .
Yet , in the present , it is so ubiquitous that we seem not to take notice of the air business .
If one were to delve into the most paramount inventions of the last century , they would probably point to modern conveniences , namely television or the computer .
We tend to underrate the importance of the aeroplane .
It is obvious that air travel has had an enormous impact on the way we conceive the world .
Firstly , as a result of its development , we can experience a noticeable surge in mass tourism .
People have ample opportunities to embark on a riveting journey to places they previously imagined while reading an adventurous book .
Besides , the great influence of the aeroplane can be seen in mass emigration .
Had it not been for the Wright brothers , emigrants and casualties would not have been able to settle in remote lands ; hence , the world would teeter financially .
As far as the vast changes that the aeroplane has undergone are concerned , society 's attitude has also improved .
In the first place , for decades , we had a distant relationship with such an initially fallible workhorse .
A classic illustration of this could be the use of air machines solely for martial purposes .
Since the 20th century was about wars , we only killed and exterminated people .
Additionally , creating such a vehicle has been our morbid fascination since time immemorial .
Nonetheless , the situation has somewhat normalized .
Air travel has transformed from a luxury at the disposal of the rich to a common option available to almost everyone .
I personally believe that the influence the aeroplane has had on our life is significant , yet we have to bear in mind the dangers connected with it .
Corrected sentence : For instance , at the beginning of the 21st century , tourists were under the constant threat of terrorists .
Moreover , the opportunities that air technology brings may easily contribute to further development .
Perhaps it will improve to such an extent that commuting from Tokyo to London would be in the twinkling of an eye .
To sum up , the airline industry and its changes have been important for the world .
Apart from minor drawbacks , we can only laud its benefits .
It has certainly had an edifying effect on our thinking about traveling .
Many years ago , people lived without all the things we have nowadays , such as mobile phones , LED TVs , computers , etc .
This means that we have experienced an important change with the passing of time , which is due to the rise of technology , and it entails that people 's lives change .
Now , will we continue to develop our technology and our lives ?
From my point of view , technology will continue changing our lives in terms of routine and free time , to the point that we will not be able to live without using it .
It is a problem ; we must not depend on items like phones , TV , and all items created by technology .
If we had to live in the past , bearing in mind all our dependency on technology , we would not be able to live in this way , I am sure of it .
Nonetheless , I think that people 's lives will improve thanks to technology . It not only refers to negative aspects like dependency on technology , but it also offers us interesting advancements such as new technologies , new information systems to improve the job market , and improvements in a wide range of sectors like agriculture and healthcare .
Finally , to sum up , I think that people 's lives will change , but not dramatically . It depends on each person and the way in which they focus their lives .
Unfortunately , I have n't seen any thrillers for ages .
The original sentence `` I prefer other genres . '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
I saw a really great comedy by Wes Anderson last month .
Its title is The Grand Budapest Hotel .
The story took place in Eastern Europe between the two World Wars .
The hotel manager used to take care of his regular clients , especially old ladies .
The hotel flourished , and the manager felt himself and behaved like a god in his small universe .
He hired the teenage Indian refugee as a bellboy and taught him all his skills .
He gave the boy a lot of lessons in hospitality , friendship , courage , and humanity .
An old man returned to the place of his youth and told the story of his friend and mentor .
Nowadays , public transport is less convenient than traveling by car because there are other solutions , like internet platforms that facilitate car-sharing at a relatively low price with people who are going to the same destination .
Sharing the car could be an alternative to save money , and it is also more comfortable than traveling with a lot of people .
First of all , public transport has fewer options ; it is too difficult to travel , for example , if you have to work nocturnal hours , and on special days , it is impossible to find a seat .
On the other hand , if you missed the bus , train , or any other public transport , you had to wait a long time for the next one , which can be maddening .
In conclusion , people prefer traveling by car because it is more comfortable ; you can go wherever you want at the time you consider best , and you can choose whether to share the space with other people or not .
Nowadays , people spend lots of money in order to go to an English-speaking country to improve their language skills .
The original sentence `` But is it really the most effective way of learning a language ? '' is already correct and does not require any changes .
From my point of view , studying in a foreign country has certain drawbacks . ( Note : The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
Firstly , this way is very expensive , as the tuition fee for overseas students is rather high .
Besides , when you study abroad , you have to adapt to a very different way of life , which can be quite stressful . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
What is more , English teachers do not speak Russian , so if you do n't know English well , you will not understand their explanation .
It is often assumed that it is better to study a language abroad because you can always use it when speaking with native speakers .
However , I doubt that we will have many opportunities to speak abroad , as we do not know many people there .
It is also believed that Russian teachers are not as qualified as those in England . ( The original sentence is already correct and does not require any changes . )
I totally disagree with this opinion because Russian teachers can compare the two languages and explain grammar rules better .
To sum up , I would argue that the best way to learn a language is to study it in your native country , as you can always get the necessary help from your teachers .
Moreover , today we have lots of opportunities to improve our skills , such as communicating with English pen friends over the Internet .
I think that we should travel abroad to practice a language , but not to study it .
